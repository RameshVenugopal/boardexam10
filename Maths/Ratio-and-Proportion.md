ICSE Class 10 Maths Study Guide: Ratio and Proportion
Key Concepts
Ratio: An ordered pair of numbers a and b written as a:b or a/b where b ≠ 0. It compares two quantities.
Compound Ratio: Combination of two or more ratios, e.g., a:b and c:d compounded to ac:bd.
Duplicate Ratio: The ratio a:b when squared becomes a²:b².
Triplicate Ratio: The ratio a:b when cubed becomes a³:b³.
Proportion: An equation stating that two ratios are equal, a/b = c/d or a:b::c:d.
Properties of Proportion: 
Componendo and Dividendo: If a/b = c/d, then (a+b)/(a-b) = (c+d)/(c-d).
Alternendo: If a/b = c/d, then a/c = b/d.
Invertendo: If a/b = c/d, then b/a = d/c.
Continued Proportion: When three quantities a, b, c are in proportion, then a/b = b/c, meaning b is the mean proportional between a and c.

Graded Practice Questions
Easy
Q1: If a : b = 2 : 3, find 5a : 5b.
Solution: 5a : 5b = 2 : 3 (since 5 is a common factor).
Q2: If x : y = 3 : 4, find the ratio (x + y) : y.
Solution: (x + y) : y = (3 + 4) : 4 = 7 : 4.
Q3: Find the fourth proportional to 3, 4, and 6.
Solution: Let the fourth be x. Then 3 : 4 :: 6 : x. Hence, x = (4 * 6) / 3 = 8.

Medium
Q4: If a : b = 2 : 3 and b : c = 5 : 4, find a : c.
Solution: a : b = 2 : 3 and b : c = 5 : 4. Thus, a : c = (2 * 5) : (3 * 4) = 10 : 12 = 5 : 6.
Q5: If (x - 3) : (x + 3) = 3 : 5, solve for x.
Solution: Cross-multiplying gives 5(x - 3) = 3(x + 3). Solving, 5x - 15 = 3x + 9, hence x = 12.
Q6: A mixture contains milk and water in the ratio 4 : 1. If 5 liters of water is added, the ratio becomes 2 : 1. Find the original quantity of milk.
Solution: Let milk be 4x and water x. After adding 5 liters, new ratio gives 4x : (x + 5) = 2 : 1. Solving gives x = 5, so milk = 20 liters.
Q7: In a class, the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. If there are 30 girls, how many students are there?
Solution: If girls are 2x, then 2x = 30, hence x = 15. Total students = 3x + 2x = 5x = 75.

Hard
Q8: If (a + b) : (a - b) = 17 : 7, find a : b.
Solution: Using componendo and dividendo, (a + b + a - b) : (a + b - a + b) = (17 + 7) : (17 - 7), thus a : b = 12 : 5.
Q9: Prove that if a, b, c are in continued proportion, then a : b = b² : ac.
Proof: Since a, b, c are in continued proportion, b² = ac. Hence, a : b = b² : ac.

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Easy
Q1 Solution: 
Explanation: Multiplying both sides of the ratio by 5 maintains the proportion.

Q2 Solution: 
Explanation: Adding a and b and then comparing it to b gives a new ratio.
