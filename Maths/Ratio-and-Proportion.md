# Ratio and Proportion - ICSE Class 10 Guide

## 1. Key Formulas

### Ratio:
- The ratio of two quantities \(a\) and \(b\) is expressed as \( \frac{a}{b} \), where \(b \neq 0\).
- If \(a:b = c:d\), then the product of the means equals the product of the extremes:  
  \[ a \cdot d = b \cdot c \]

### Proportion:
- A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal:  
  \[ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \]
  It is written as \(a : b = c : d\).

- Cross-multiplying the proportion:  
  \[ a \cdot d = b \cdot c \]

### Direct Proportion:
- If \(x\) and \(y\) are in direct proportion, then:  
  \[ \frac{x}{y} = k \quad \text{(where } k \text{ is a constant)} \]

### Inverse Proportion:
- If \(x\) and \(y\) are in inverse proportion, then:  
  \[ x \cdot y = k \quad \text{(where } k \text{ is a constant)} \]

### Compound Proportion:
- When there are more than two quantities, the compound proportion can be solved by using the concept of direct or inverse proportion.

## 2. Common Question Patterns

Based on the last 10 years of ICSE Class 10 board exams, the following question patterns are common:

- **Direct Questions on Ratios and Proportions (Direct & Inverse):** These questions are usually based on simple problems where students are asked to find the missing terms in a ratio or proportion.
- **Application-based Questions:** Questions involving real-world situations like speed, distance, and time, sharing of profits, or mixing of substances.
- **Word Problems:** These questions ask students to apply the concepts of ratios and proportions in everyday scenarios.
- **Verification of Proportions:** In some cases, students are given four quantities and are asked to verify whether they form a proportion.
- **Compound Proportions:** A little more complex, involving more than two quantities.

### Question Types:
1. **Direct Questions:** Given two ratios, find the third term.
2. **Application-based Questions:** Calculate time, distance, or shared quantities.
3. **Reasoning Questions:** Verify if given ratios form a proportion or not.
4. **Word Problems:** Involves scenarios requiring real-life application.

## 3. Sample Questions

### Sample Question 1: Direct Proportion
**Q:** If 5 workers can complete a job in 12 days, how many days will it take for 8 workers to complete the same job?

### Sample Question 2: Inverse Proportion
**Q:** If 4 men can complete a piece of work in 20 days, how many men are required to finish the work in 15 days?

### Sample Question 3: Compound Proportion
**Q:** If 5 men can complete a job in 8 days and 4 women can complete the same job in 10 days, how long will it take for 3 men and 6 women to finish the work together?

### Sample Question 4: Application-based Problem (Speed, Distance, Time)
**Q:** A car travels 100 km in 2 hours. How long will it take to travel 350 km at the same speed?

### Sample Question 5: Word Problem on Mixtures
**Q:** A solution of saltwater contains 30% salt. How much of the solution must be taken to get 120 grams of salt?

### Sample Question 6: Proportions in Profit Sharing
**Q:** A business is started by two partners, A and B, with investments of Rs. 5000 and Rs. 3000, respectively. If the total profit after one year is Rs. 2000, find their respective shares in the profit.

### Sample Question 7: Verification of Proportion
**Q:** Verify whether the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 18 form a proportion.

## 4. Detailed Solutions

### Solution 1: Direct Proportion
**Q:** If 5 workers can complete a job in 12 days, how many days will it take for 8 workers to complete the same job?

**Solution:**  
Let the number of days required by 8 workers be \( x \).  
Since the number of workers and the number of days are inversely proportional,  
\[
\text{Workers} \times \text{Days} = \text{Constant}
\]
\[
5 \times 12 = 8 \times x
\]
\[
60 = 8x
\]
\[
x = \frac{60}{8} = 7.5 \text{ days}
\]
Hence, it will take 8 workers 7.5 days to complete the job.

### Solution 2: Inverse Proportion
**Q:** If 4 men can complete a piece of work in 20 days, how many men are required to finish the work in 15 days?

**Solution:**  
Let the number of men required be \( x \).  
Since the number of men and the number of days are inversely proportional,  
\[
\text{Men} \times \text{Days} = \text{Constant}
\]
\[
4 \times 20 = x \times 15
\]
\[
80 = 15x
\]
\[
x = \frac{80}{15} \approx 5.33 \text{ men}
\]
Hence, approximately 5.33 men are required to complete the work in 15 days.
