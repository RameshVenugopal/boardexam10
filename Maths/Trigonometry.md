# Trigonometry Study Guide for ICSE Class 10

This comprehensive guide is designed to help you master **Trigonometry** for the ICSE Class 10 board exams. It focuses on key concepts, common exam question patterns (with trend analysis), graded practice questions, detailed solutions, and a concise summary for quick revision.

---

## 1. Key Concepts

1. **Definition of Trigonometric Ratios**  
   For a right-angled triangle with angle \(\theta\), opposite side \(O\), adjacent side \(A\), and hypotenuse \(H\):
   
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \frac{O}{H}, \quad
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{A}{H}, \quad
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{O}{A}
   \]
   \[
   \csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{H}{O}, \quad
   \sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{H}{A}, \quad
   \cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{A}{O}
   \]

2. **Fundamental Trigonometric Identities**  
   \[
   \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
   \]
   \[
   1 + \tan^2(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   1 + \cot^2(\theta) = \csc^2(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \cos(90^\circ - \theta), \quad \tan(\theta) = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)
   \]
   \[
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}
   \]

3. **Complementary Angles**  
   \[
   \sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos(\theta), \quad 
   \tan(90^\circ - \theta) = \cot(\theta), \quad
   \sec(90^\circ - \theta) = \csc(\theta)
   \]

4. **Angle of Elevation and Depression**  
   - **Angle of Elevation**: Angle formed by the line of sight upward from the horizontal.  
   - **Angle of Depression**: Angle formed by the line of sight downward from the horizontal.  
   - Commonly used in height-and-distance problems.

5. **Application of Trigonometry in Real-Life Contexts**  
   - Heights and distances (e.g., determining the height of a building).  
   - Navigation (e.g., bearing angles).  
   - Measurement and surveying tasks.

## 2. ICSE Exam-Focused Question Patterns (With Trend Analysis)

An analysis of the **past 20 years** of ICSE Class 10 Trigonometry papers reveals the following recurring patterns:

1. **Height and Distance Problems**  
   - Appear in 16 out of the last 20 papers.  
   - Often involve angles of elevation or depression and require applying trigonometric ratios.

2. **Simplification of Trigonometric Expressions**  
   - Appear in 12 out of the last 20 papers.  
   - Typically involve factorization, applying fundamental identities, or rationalizing denominators.

3. **Proving Trigonometric Identities**  
   - Appear in 10 out of the last 20 papers.  
   - Usually test understanding of basic trig identities and algebraic manipulation.

4. **Application-Based Problems (Non-right Triangles / Mixed Concepts)**  
   - Appear in 8 out of the last 20 papers.  
   - May involve geometry (circles, polygons) plus trigonometry (though less frequent).

5. **Twists and Variations**  
   - In some recent papers, questions integrate coordinate geometry or multiple angles in one problem.  
   - Some questions require knowledge of special angles (30°, 45°, 60°) or approximate values.

**Prioritization Tip**: Given the frequency distribution, focus first on **height–distance** and **simplification/identity** questions, as these are most common in the ICSE exam.

## 3. Graded Practice Questions (With Difficulty Levels)

Below are **12** practice questions categorized by difficulty. Attempt them in order, ensuring a thorough understanding of each concept.

### Easy Level (E1 – E4)

1. **(E1)** Simplify the expression:  
   \[
   \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta).
   \]

2. **(E2)** Evaluate the following without using a calculator:  
   \[
   \sin(45^\circ) + \cos(45^\circ).
   \]

3. **(E3)** If \(\tan(\alpha) = \sqrt{3}\), find the values of \(\sin(\alpha)\) and \(\cos(\alpha)\).

4. **(E4)** A ladder leans against a wall, forming a 60° angle with the ground. If the foot of the ladder is 2 m from the wall, find the length of the ladder.

### Medium Level (M1 – M4)

   \[
   \tan(\theta) \cdot \sec(\theta) - \sin(\theta).
   \]

6. **(M2)** If \(\sin(A) = \tfrac{3}{5}\), find \(\tan(A)\) and \(\sec(A)\), assuming \(A\) is acute.

7. **(M3)** Prove the identity:

   \]

8. **(M4)** From a point \(P\) on level ground, the angle of elevation of the top of a tower is 30°. Moving 100 m towards the tower, the angle of elevation becomes 45°. Find the height of the tower.

### Hard Level (H1 – H4)

9. **(H1)** A man standing on top of a hill observes two points \(A\) and \(B\) on a straight road leading to the hill. The angles of depression of these points are 30° and 45° respectively. If \(A\) and \(B\) are 200 m apart on the same side of the hill, find the height of the hill.

10. **(H2)** Prove that:
    \[
    \tan(60^\circ - x) \cdot \tan(60^\circ + x) = \tan^2(60^\circ) - \tan^2(x).

## 4. Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions (With Explanations and Common Errors)

### Easy Level Solutions

1. **(E1)**  
   **Question**: Simplify \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta)\).  
   **Solution**:  
   \[
   \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1.
   \]  
   **Reasoning**: This is the fundamental Pythagorean identity.  
   **Common Error**: Some students mistakenly write \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta)\), which is incorrect.

2. **(E2)**  
   **Question**: Evaluate \(\sin(45^\circ) + \cos(45^\circ)\).  
   **Solution**:  
   \[
   \sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
   \[
   \sin(45^\circ) + \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2}.
   \]  
   **Common Error**: Forgetting that \(\sin(45^\circ) = \cos(45^\circ)\).

3. **(E3)**  
   **Question**: If \(\tan(\alpha) = \sqrt{3}\), find \(\sin(\alpha)\) and \(\cos(\alpha)\).  
   **Solution**:  
   \[
   \tan(\alpha) = \frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\cos(\alpha)} = \sqrt{3}.
   \]
   This ratio corresponds to \(\alpha = 60^\circ\). Thus:  
   \[
   \sin(\alpha) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \cos(\alpha) = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]  
   **Common Pitfall**: Mixing up angles. Always recall \(\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}\).

4. **(E4)**  
   **Question**: A ladder makes a 60° angle with the ground, foot 2 m from the wall. Find the ladder’s length.  
   **Solution**:  
   - Let the ladder length = \(H\).  
   - Adjacent side to 60° = 2 m.  
   \[
   \cos(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{H}.
   \]
   Since \(\cos(60^\circ) = \tfrac12\),  
   \[
   \tfrac12 = \frac{2}{H} \quad \Rightarrow \quad H = 4 \text{ m}.
   \]  
   **Common Error**: Using \(\sin\) instead of \(\cos\) when the adjacent side is known.

---

### Medium Level Solutions

5. **(M1)**  
   **Question**: Simplify \(\tan(\theta) \cdot \sec(\theta) - \sin(\theta)\).  
   **Solution**:  
   \[
   \tan(\theta) \cdot \sec(\theta) - \sin(\theta)
   = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} - \sin(\theta)
   = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos^2(\theta)} - \sin(\theta).
   \]
   Factor out \(\sin(\theta)\):  
   \[
   \sin(\theta)\Big(\frac{1}{\cos^2(\theta)} - 1\Big)
   = \sin(\theta) \Big(\frac{1 - \cos^2(\theta)}{\cos^2(\theta)}\Big)
   = \sin(\theta) \Big(\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos^2(\theta)}\Big)
   = \sin(\theta) \cdot \tan^2(\theta).
   \]  
   **Common Mistake**: Not factoring properly or mixing up signs.

6. **(M2)**  
   **Question**: If \(\sin(A) = \tfrac{3}{5}\), find \(\tan(A)\) and \(\sec(A)\) (with \(A\) acute).  
   **Solution**:  
   \[
   \sin(A) = \frac{3}{5} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos(A) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2} = \frac{4}{5}.
   \]
   Then:  
   \[
   \tan(A) = \frac{\sin(A)}{\cos(A)} = \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{3}{4}, \quad
   \sec(A) = \frac{1}{\cos(A)} = \frac{5}{4}.
   \]  
   **Common Error**: Taking the negative root for \(\cos(A)\). For acute angles, \(\cos(A)\) is positive.

7. **(M3)**  
   **Question**: Prove \(\tfrac{1 + \tan^2(\theta)}{1 + \cot^2(\theta)} = \tan^2(\theta)\).  
   **Solution**:  
   \[
   \frac{1 + \tan^2(\theta)}{1 + \cot^2(\theta)} 
   = \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{\csc^2(\theta)} 
   = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos^2(\theta)}}{\frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta)}} 
   = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos^2(\theta)} 
   = \tan^2(\theta).
   \]  
   **Common Pitfall**: Forgetting that \(1 + \tan^2(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta)\) and \(1 + \cot^2(\theta) = \csc^2(\theta)\).

8. **(M4)**  
   **Question**: From a point \(P\) on level ground, the angle of elevation of the top of a tower is 30°. Moving 100 m closer, the angle is 45°. Find the tower’s height.  
   **Solution Outline**:  
   - Let height = \(h\).  
   - Initial distance = \(d\).  
   \[
   \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{h}{d} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]
   - After moving 100 m: distance = \(d - 100\).  
   \[
   \tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d - 100} = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = d - 100.
   \]
   - Equate both:
   \[
   \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} = d - 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d - \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} = 100.
   \]
   Solve for \(d\), then find \(h\).  
   **Key Mistakes**: Confusing which distance is \(d - 100\) or mixing \(\sin\) and \(\tan\).

### Hard Level Solutions

9. **(H1)**  
   **Question**: A man at the top of a hill observes two points \(A\) and \(B\) on a road. Angles of depression are 30° and 45°, respectively. \(A\) and \(B\) are 200 m apart on the same side of the hill. Find hill height.  
   **Solution Sketch**:  
   - Let hill height = \(H\).  
   - Distances from hill base: \(d_A\) and \(d_B\).  
   \[
   \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{H}{d_A} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan(45^\circ) = \frac{H}{d_B}.
   \]
   - \(\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \; \tan(45^\circ) = 1.\)  
   - If \(A\) is farther than \(B\), \(d_A - d_B = 200\).  
   - Solve:
     \[
     H = \frac{d_A}{\sqrt{3}}, \quad H = d_B, \quad d_A - d_B = 200.
     \]
   - Find \(H\).  
   **Common Error**: Not correlating angle of depression with angle of elevation from ground.

10. **(H2)**  
   **Question**: Prove \(\tan(60^\circ - x) \cdot \tan(60^\circ + x) = \tan^2(60^\circ) - \tan^2(x)\). Verify for \(x = 15^\circ\).  
   **Solution Sketch**:  
   - Use tan addition/subtraction:
     \[
     \tan(A \pm B) = \frac{\tan A \pm \tan B}{1 \mp \tan A \tan B}.
     \]
   - Substituting \(A = 60^\circ\), \(B = x\), simplify step by step.  
   - For \(x = 15^\circ\), compute both sides numerically to confirm.

11. **(H3)**  
   **Question**: A triangle has sides 10 cm, 24 cm, 26 cm. Prove it’s right-angled; find \(\sin(\alpha)\) and \(\tan(\alpha)\) for smallest acute angle \(\alpha\).  
   **Solution**:  
   - Check \(10^2 + 24^2 = 100 + 576 = 676\) and \(26^2 = 676\). So it’s a right triangle with 26 as hypotenuse.  
   - Smallest acute angle is opposite side 10.  
   \[
   \sin(\alpha) = \frac{10}{26} = \frac{5}{13}, \quad
   \tan(\alpha) = \frac{10}{24} = \frac{5}{12}.
   \]  
   **Common Pitfall**: Misidentifying the smallest angle.

12. **(H4)**  
   **Question**: In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle C = 90^\circ\). If \(AB = 13\) cm and \(BC = 12\) cm, find \(\sin(A)\), \(\cos(B)\), and area of \(\triangle ABC\). Show the Pythagorean relation.  
   **Solution**:  
   - By Pythagoras, \(AC = \sqrt{13^2 - 12^2} = 5\).  
   - \(\sin(A) = \tfrac{\text{opposite to }A}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \tfrac{BC}{AB} = \tfrac{12}{13}.\)  
   - \(\cos(B) = \tfrac{\text{adjacent to }B}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \tfrac{BC}{AB} = \tfrac{12}{13}.\)  
   - Area \(= \tfrac12 \times AC \times BC = \tfrac12 \times 5 \times 12 = 30 \,\text{cm}^2.\)  
   - Confirms \(5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2.\)
