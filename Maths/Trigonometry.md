## 1. Key Concepts

### 1.1 Introduction to Trigonometry

- **Definition:** Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics dealing with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles (particularly right-angled triangles).
- **Right Triangle and Ratios:** 
  - In a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the right angle is called the **hypotenuse**.
  - The other two sides are typically referred to as the **base** (adjacent) and the **height** (opposite) with respect to a specific angle.

```
   Right triangle ABC with angle ∠C = 90°
   
       A
       |\
       | \
height |  \ hypotenuse
       |   \
       |    \
       C-----B
         base
```

- **Basic Trigonometric Ratios** (for angle θ in a right triangle):

  ```
  sin θ   = Opposite / Hypotenuse
  cos θ   = Adjacent / Hypotenuse
  tan θ   = Opposite / Adjacent
  
  cosec θ = 1 / sin θ = Hypotenuse / Opposite
  sec θ   = 1 / cos θ = Hypotenuse / Adjacent
  cot θ   = 1 / tan θ = Adjacent / Opposite
  ```

### 1.2 Fundamental Identities

1. **Pythagorean Identity**  
   ```
   sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
   1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
   1 + cot²θ = cosec²θ
   ```
2. **Complementary Angles**  
   ```
   sin(90° - θ) = cos θ
   cos(90° - θ) = sin θ
   tan(90° - θ) = cot θ
   ```

### 1.3 Angles of Elevation and Depression

- **Angle of Elevation:** If you stand on the ground and look up at an object, the angle formed between the horizontal line of sight and the line of sight to the object is the *angle of elevation*.
- **Angle of Depression:** If you look down from a certain height to an object, the angle formed between the horizontal line of sight and the line of sight to the object is the *angle of depression*.
- **Key Concept:** Angles of elevation and depression are alternate interior angles; thus, they are *equal* when measured from a horizontal line.

### 1.4 Practical Applications

- **Heights and Distances:** Using trigonometric ratios, one can find unknown heights or distances by measuring an angle and using known distances (e.g., a building’s height can be calculated if we know the distance from the building and the angle of elevation).
- **Real-World Examples:** 
  - Measuring the height of a tower using angles of elevation.
  - Determining the distance of a ship from a lighthouse using angles of depression.

## 2. ICSE Exam-Focused Question Patterns (with Trend Analysis)

The following analysis is based on recurring question types observed in **past 20 years** of ICSE Class 10 Mathematics board exam papers. While the exact details may vary year to year, the fundamental types of questions remain consistent.

### 2.1 Recurring Question Patterns

1. **Direct Application of Trigonometric Ratios**  
   - Typical frequency: *In 15 out of the last 20 papers.*
   - Often involves computing the lengths of sides in a right triangle using basic ratios (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`).

2. **Angle of Elevation/Depression**  
   - Typical frequency: *In 12 out of the last 20 papers.*
   - Usually a word problem requiring drawing a diagram and identifying the appropriate trig ratio.

3. **Proving Geometric Relationships**  
   - Typical frequency: *In 10 out of the last 20 papers.*
   - Sometimes integrated with circle theorems (e.g., tangents, secants) or similarity of triangles. You might see a problem linking the Pythagorean theorem with trigonometry.

4. **Problems Involving Combined Angles & Lengths**  
   - Typical frequency: *Appears in about 8 out of 20 papers.*
   - These require applying more than one concept: for instance, using *angle sum identities* or applying trigonometric ratios in multiple steps to find unknown angles or sides.

5. **Variations/Twists**  
   - The exam sometimes includes **a twist** such as:
     - Inverse Trigonometric aspects (simple forms, if at all).
     - A geometry-based problem where trigonometry is only implied, not directly stated.
     - Composite figures needing multiple triangles or additional constructions.

## 4. Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions (with Explanations and Common Errors)

> **Important:** Review the solutions carefully and identify any steps where you might make computational or conceptual errors.

### Solution to Question 1 (Easy)

1. **Given:**
   - \(\triangle ABC\) with \(\angle C = 90^\circ\).
   - \(AB = 13 \) cm (hypotenuse).
   - \(BC = 5 \) cm.
   - We need \(AC\), \(\sin A\), and \(\cos A\).

2. **Find \( AC \)**  
   By Pythagoras’ theorem:  
   \[
   AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 + 5^2 = 13^2
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 = 169 - 25 = 144
   \]
   \[
   AC = 12 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Find \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\)**  
   - **Identify sides w.r.t \(\angle A\)**  
     - Opposite side to \(\angle A\) is \( BC = 5\) cm.  
     - Adjacent side to \(\angle A\) is \( AC = 12\) cm.  
     - Hypotenuse is \( AB = 13\) cm.

   - **Compute**  
     ```
     sin A = Opposite / Hypotenuse = 5/13
     cos A = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = 12/13
     ```

4. **Common Errors:**
   - Mixing up opposite and adjacent sides.
   - Forgetting which angle is being referenced (A vs. B).

---

### Solution to Question 2 (Easy)

1. **Given:**  
   - A ladder makes a \( 60^\circ \) angle with the ground.
   - The foot of the ladder is 5 m away from the wall.
   - Need to find the length of the ladder (hypotenuse).

2. **Diagram (Conceptual):**

   ```
   Wall (vertical)
    |
    |) 60°
    | \
    |  \  Ladder
    |   \
    +----+ Ground
       5 m
   ```

3. **Using `cos θ` or `sin θ`:**
   - If we let \( L \) = length of ladder,
   - The side adjacent to \( 60^\circ \) is 5 m (horizontal distance).
   - The hypotenuse is \( L \).

   \[
   \cos 60^\circ = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{5}{L}
   \]
   \[
   \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{L} \implies L = 10 \text{ m}
   \]

4. **Common Errors:**
   - Using the wrong ratio (e.g., using \(\sin\) instead of \(\cos\)).
   - Failing to correctly identify the adjacent side vs. the opposite side.

---

### Solution to Question 3 (Medium)

1. **Given:**  
   - Height of kite above ground = 20 m.
   - Angle of elevation of the kite’s string = \( 30^\circ \).
   - Need length of the string.

2. **Diagram (Conceptual):**

   ```
     Kite
       *
       |) 30°
       |\
       | \
     20m \ 
       |   \
       +----+ Person
   ```

3. **Trigonometric Ratio:**
   - Consider the right triangle formed by the person’s horizontal line of sight and the vertical line to the kite.
   - Opposite side = 20 m (height), Hypotenuse = length of string (say \( S \)).

   \[
   \sin 30^\circ = \frac{20}{S}
   \]
   \[
   \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} = \frac{20}{S} \implies S = 40 \text{ m}
   \]

4. **Common Errors:**
   - Mixing up sine and tangent.  
   - Not realizing that “height” is the side opposite to the angle of elevation.

---

### Solution to Question 4 (Medium)

1. **Given:**  
   - In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle R = 90^\circ\).
   - \(\tan P = \frac{3}{4}\).

2. **Find \(\sin Q\)**  
   - In a right triangle with angles \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R=90^\circ\), note \(P + Q = 90^\circ\).  
   - Therefore, \(Q = 90^\circ - P\).  
   \[
   \sin Q = \sin(90^\circ - P) = \cos P
   \]
   - Since \(\tan P = \frac{3}{4}\), we can represent sides (opposite to \(P\) as 3k, adjacent to \(P\) as 4k, and hypotenuse as 5k, for some \(k\)).  
   \[
   \cos P = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{4k}{5k} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]
   Hence,
   \[
   \sin Q = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

3. **Find \(\cos P\)**  
   \[
   \cos P = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

4. **Ratio of sides \(PQ : QR : RP\)**  
   - If \(PQ\) is opposite to \(\angle R\), \(QR\) is opposite to \(\angle P\), and \(RP\) is opposite to \(\angle Q\):  
   - From \(\tan P = \frac{3}{4}\), we can label the triangle sides:  
     - Opposite (to \(P\)) = 3 units  
     - Adjacent (to \(P\)) = 4 units  
     - Hypotenuse = 5 units  
   - Need to match them correctly with the triangle naming:
     - \( QR = \text{Opposite to } P = 3 \)
     - \( RP = \text{Adjacent to } P = 4 \)
     - \( PQ = \text{Hypotenuse} = 5 \)  
   - Thus the ratio is:
     ```
     PQ : QR : RP = 5 : 3 : 4
     ```

5. **Common Errors:**
   - Confusing which side corresponds to which angle.
   - Mixing up triangle notation (which side is PQ, QR, RP).

---

### Solution to Question 5 (Medium)

1. **Given:**  
   - A person on top of a 40 m building.  
   - Angle of depression of a car on the ground = \( 45^\circ \).

2. **Conceptual Diagram:**

   ```
   Person
   (Top of Bldg)  *------------  40m
                  |
                  |45°
                  |
                  +------ Car
   ```

3. **Angle of Depression = Angle of Elevation**  
   - Inside the right triangle, the angle at the person’s eyes is \( 45^\circ \) to the horizontal.  
   - Opposite side = 40 m (height of building).  
   - Adjacent side = distance from the building (say \( d \)).

4. **Use \(\tan\) ratio**  
   \[
   \tan 45^\circ = \frac{40}{d}
   \]
   \[
   \tan 45^\circ = 1
   \]
   \[
   1 = \frac{40}{d} \implies d = 40 \text{ m}
   \]

5. **Common Errors:**
   - Not applying the fact that angle of depression equals angle of elevation.
   - Using sine or cosine incorrectly.

---

### Solution to Question 6 (Hard)

1. **Given:**  
   - Two points \(A\) and \(B\) on opposite sides of tower \(T\).  
   - Angles of elevation: \( \angle AT = 60^\circ \), \( \angle BT = 30^\circ \).  
   - \(A\) and \(B\) are 100 m apart in a straight line passing through the tower’s foot.  
   - Need to find tower’s height (\(h\)).

2. **Label the Points:**

   ```
   A --------- T (Foot of tower) ---------- B
   \           | (Tower)
    \    60°   |   30°
     \         | (height h)
      \        |
       +-------+
        100 m
   ```

3. **Method:**
   - Let \(AT_{\text{foot}} = x\). Then \( BT_{\text{foot}} = 100 - x \).
   - From right triangle with angle \(60^\circ\):  
     \[
     \tan 60^\circ = \frac{h}{x} = \sqrt{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \sqrt{3} \, x
     \]
   - From right triangle with angle \(30^\circ\):  
     \[
     \tan 30^\circ = \frac{h}{100 - x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{100 - x}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - Equate these two expressions for \(h\):  
     \[
     \sqrt{3} \, x = \frac{100 - x}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
     \[
     3x = 100 - x
     \]
     \[
     4x = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 25
     \]
   - Now, \( h = \sqrt{3} \times 25 = 25\sqrt{3} \) m.

4. **Common Errors:**
   - Misinterpreting which segment is \( x \) and which is \( 100 - x \).
   - Mixing up angles or failing to keep track of where the tower foot is located.

### Solution to Question 7 (Hard)

1. **Given:**  
   - In a circle, chord \(AB\) subtends a right angle (\(90^\circ\)) at \(C\).  
   - \(AC = 6\) cm, \(BC = 8\) cm.  
   - Prove the circle’s radius \(R = 5\) cm.

2. **Conceptual Approach:**
   - \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\). By a circle theorem, if a chord subtends a right angle at a point on the circumference, that chord is the diameter. Alternatively, you can show that \(AB\) must be the diameter using the Pythagorean relationship in \(\triangle ABC\).
   - So we suspect \(AB = 10\) cm (because \(6^2 + 8^2 = 100\), and \(\sqrt{100} = 10\)).

3. **Steps:**
   \[
   AC^2 + BC^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100
   \]
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ cm}
   \]
   - In a circle, if a triangle inscribed in the circle is right-angled, the side opposite the right angle is the diameter. Thus:
     \[
     \text{Diameter} = AB = 10 \text{ cm}
     \quad \Rightarrow \quad
     \text{Radius} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ cm}
     \]

4. **Common Errors:**
   - Not recognizing the right angle subtended by a chord implies the chord is the diameter.
   - Missing the direct Pythagorean link.

---

### Solution to Question 8 (Hard)

1. **Given:**
   - Triangle \( XYZ \) with sides:
     \[
     XY = 10 \text{ cm}, \quad YZ = 17 \text{ cm}, \quad XZ = 21 \text{ cm}
     \]
   - Need to determine whether \(\angle Y\) is acute, right, or obtuse using trigonometry (or a Pythagorean-like approach).

2. **Check Pythagoras at \( \angle Y \)**  
   - The side opposite \(\angle Y\) is \(XZ = 21\).
   - The remaining two sides are \(XY = 10\) and \(YZ = 17\).
   - Compare \( XZ^2 \) with \( XY^2 + YZ^2 \).

   \[
   XZ^2 = 21^2 = 441
   \]
   \[
   XY^2 + YZ^2 = 10^2 + 17^2 = 100 + 289 = 389
   \]

3. **Interpretation:**
   - If \(XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2\), then \(\angle Y\) is a right angle.
   - If \(XZ^2 > XY^2 + YZ^2\), then \(\angle Y\) is obtuse.
   - If \(XZ^2 < XY^2 + YZ^2\), then \(\angle Y\) is acute.

   Here, \(441 > 389\).  
   Thus, \(XZ^2 > XY^2 + YZ^2\).  
   **Therefore, \(\angle Y\) is an obtuse angle**.

4. **Common Errors:**
   - Mixing up which side is opposite which angle.
   - Not using the correct inequality to determine the nature of the angle.

## 5. Concise Summary and Key Takeaways (for Quick Revision)

- **Trigonometric Ratios:**  
  ```
  sin θ = Opp/Hyp,   cos θ = Adj/Hyp,   tan θ = Opp/Adj
  ```
- **Fundamental Identities:**  
  ```
  sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
  1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
  ```
- **Complementary Angles:**  
  ```
  sin(90° - θ) = cos θ,   tan(90° - θ) = cot θ
  ```
- **Angle of Elevation & Depression:** The angle of depression from a horizontal is numerically equal to the angle of elevation from the ground.  
- **Pythagorean Theorem in Trigonometry:**  
  - Right triangle side relationships often reduce to the pythagorean identity.  
  - If a chord subtends a right angle at the circumference, it is a diameter of the circle (used in circle-based trig problems).  
- **Common Mistakes:**  
  - Confusing adjacent vs. opposite sides.  
  - Misidentifying which angle is referenced in the problem.  
  - Ignoring the fact that \(\angle\) of depression = \(\angle\) of elevation.

> **Tip for ICSE Exams:**  
> - Always draw a clear diagram (even if roughly) to identify which sides are opposite, adjacent, or the hypotenuse.  
> - Write down known trigonometric ratios and confirm you are using the correct ratio for the given data.  
> - Practice time management: these problems can be solved quickly if you have the right approach from the start.
