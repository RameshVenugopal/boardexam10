ICSE Class 10 Trigonometry Study Guide
Key Concepts
Trigonometric Ratios: Understand sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent for angles in a right-angled triangle.
Definitions: 
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}
, 
\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}
, 
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}
Trigonometric Identities:
Basic Identities: 
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta
1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta
Complementary Angles: 
\sin (90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta
\cos (90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta
