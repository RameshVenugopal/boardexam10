# Comprehensive Study Guide: Trigonometry (ICSE Class 10)

Welcome to this comprehensive study guide on **Trigonometry** for ICSE Class 10. This guide is optimized for exam preparation and focuses on understanding key concepts, application-based problem-solving, and effective revision strategies. 

---

## 1. Key Concepts

Trigonometry deals with the relationships between the angles and sides of right-angled triangles and extends to various identities and applications.

### 1.1 Basic Trigonometric Ratios

Consider a right-angled triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the right angle at \( C \). Let the angle at \( A \) be \( \theta \).

```
Right triangle diagram (ASCII):

     A
     |\
     | \
     |  \
     |   \
  (c)|    \ (b)
     |     \
     |      \
     C-------B
        (a)

- AC = Opposite side to angle θ
- BC = Adjacent side to angle θ
- AB = Hypotenuse
```

The six trigonometric ratios are defined as follows:

```
\sin \theta  = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{AC}{AB}
\cos \theta  = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AB}
\tan \theta  = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}   = \frac{AC}{BC}

\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}    = \frac{AB}{AC}
\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}    = \frac{AB}{BC}
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}    = \frac{BC}{AC}
```

**Implications:**
1. These ratios allow us to find unknown sides or angles in right triangles.
2. \(\sin \theta\) and \(\cos \theta\) range between \(-1\) and \(+1\), with the primary focus on \(0 \leq \theta \leq 90^\circ\) (for Class 10).
3. \(\tan \theta\), \(\csc \theta\), \(\sec \theta\), and \(\cot \theta\) can take values from \(0\) to \(+\infty\).

### 1.2 Standard Angles and Their Values

Certain angles—\(0^\circ\), \(30^\circ\), \(45^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\)—have specific known values for each trigonometric ratio. **Memorizing** or **knowing how to derive** these is crucial:

| Angle (\(\theta\)) | \(\sin \theta\) | \(\cos \theta\) | \(\tan \theta\) |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| \(0^\circ\)        | 0               | 1               | 0               |
| \(30^\circ\)       | \(\frac{1}{2}\) | \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) | \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) |
| \(45^\circ\)       | \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) | \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) | 1               |
| \(60^\circ\)       | \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) | \(\frac{1}{2}\) | \(\sqrt{3}\)    |
| \(90^\circ\)       | 1               | 0               | Undefined       |

### 1.3 Fundamental Trigonometric Identities

1. **Pythagorean Identities**:
   ```
   \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
   1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta
   1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta
   ```
2. **Complementary Angle Identities** (used often in ICSE):
   ```
   \sin (90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta
   \cos (90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta
   \tan (90^\circ - \theta) = \cot \theta
   ```
3. **Angle Sum and Difference Identities** (less common in Class 10, but good to know):
   ```
   \sin (A \pm B) = \sin A \cos B \pm \cos A \sin B
   \cos (A \pm B) = \cos A \cos B \mp \sin A \sin B
   ```

**Implications:**  
- These identities help simplify trigonometric expressions and prove relationships between angles.

### 1.4 Height and Distance Applications

Trigonometry is extensively used to find heights of objects and distances between points when direct measurement is not feasible.

1. **Angle of Elevation**: The angle between the horizontal line of sight and the line of sight to an object above the horizontal.
2. **Angle of Depression**: The angle between the horizontal line of sight and the line of sight to an object below the horizontal.

Diagrams for height and distance problems often look like this:

```
     Top of the tower
           T
           |
           | (height)
           |
     A -----O (Eye-Level / Observer)
          \ |
  Angle     \|
    of       \
 Elevation    \
               B (Base / Ground)
```

## 2. ICSE Exam-Focused Question Patterns (with Trend Analysis)

An analysis of the last **10 years of ICSE Class 10** Mathematics papers reveals the following trends for Trigonometry:

1. **Direct Application of Trig Ratios**  
   *Frequency: ~9 out of 10 papers*  
   Typically involves finding unknown sides or angles in right-angled triangles.

2. **Heights and Distances (Angle of Elevation/Depression)**  
   *Frequency: ~8 out of 10 papers*  
   Often a word problem with a tower, building, or ladder scenario.

3. **Trigonometric Identities and Simplification**  
   *Frequency: ~7 out of 10 papers*  
   Questions may ask to prove an identity or simplify an expression using \(\sin\), \(\cos\), \(\tan\), etc.

4. **Complementary Angles**  
   *Frequency: ~5 out of 10 papers*  
   Problems testing the relationship \(\sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\) and other complementary angle properties.

5. **Combined Angle or Multi-Step Problems**  
   *Frequency: ~4 out of 10 papers*  
   May involve multi-stage geometry/trigonometry questions where one has to apply multiple theorems or relationships in sequence.

**Variations/Twists**:
- Some problems include **mixed concepts**, e.g., using Pythagoras’ theorem in conjunction with trigonometry.
- Occasional extended problems requiring both **heights and distances** plus algebraic manipulations.

8. **(Hard)**  
   Evaluate (and simplify) the following expression **without using a calculator**:
   \[
   \frac{\sin 45^\circ \cdot \cos 30^\circ + \tan 60^\circ}{\cot 30^\circ - \sec 45^\circ}.
   \]

---

## 4. Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions (with Explanations and Common Errors)

### **Solution 1 (Easy)**

**Problem:** A right-angled triangle has an angle of \(30^\circ\). If the hypotenuse is \(10 \, \text{cm}\), find the opposite side to the \(30^\circ\) angle.

1. **Identify the ratio**: \(\sin 30^\circ = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}\).
2. **Substitute known values**:
   \[
   \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \text{hypotenuse} = 10 \, \text{cm}.
   \]
3. **Compute**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{10} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Opposite} = 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \, \text{cm}.
   \]

**Common Error**: Mixing up opposite and adjacent sides. Always label sides relative to the angle in question.

---

### **Solution 2 (Easy)**

**Problem:** Simplify the expression:  
\[
\frac{\sin(90^\circ - \theta)}{\cos \theta}.
\]

1. **Use Complementary Angle Identity**: \(\sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\).
2. **Simplify**:  
   \[
   \frac{\sin(90^\circ - \theta)}{\cos \theta} 
   = \frac{\cos \theta}{\cos \theta} 
   = 1.
   \]

**Common Error**: Forgetting that \(\sin(90^\circ - \theta)\) and \(\cos \theta\) are equal.

---

### **Solution 3 (Medium)**

**Problem:** Prove that \(\frac{1 + \tan^2 \theta}{1 + \cot^2 \theta} = \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta}\).

1. **Rewrite \(\cot \theta\) in terms of \(\tan \theta\)**:
   \[
   \cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}, 
   \quad \cot^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\tan^2 \theta}.
   \]
2. **Substitute**:
   \[
   \frac{1 + \tan^2 \theta}{1 + \cot^2 \theta}
   = \frac{1 + \tan^2 \theta}{1 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 \theta}}.
   \]
3. **Simplify denominator**:
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 \theta} 
   = \frac{\tan^2 \theta + 1}{\tan^2 \theta}.
   \]
4. **Combine**:
   \[
   \frac{1 + \tan^2 \theta}{1 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 \theta}}
   = \frac{1 + \tan^2 \theta}{\frac{\tan^2 \theta + 1}{\tan^2 \theta}}
   = (1 + \tan^2 \theta) \times \frac{\tan^2 \theta}{\tan^2 \theta + 1}
   = \tan^2 \theta.
   \]
5. **Use Pythagorean Identity**: \(\tan^2 \theta = \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta}\).

Hence proved:
\[
\frac{1 + \tan^2 \theta}{1 + \cot^2 \theta} = \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta}.
\]

**Common Error**: Not simplifying correctly due to algebraic manipulation mistakes.

---

### **Solution 4 (Medium)**

**Problem:** A ladder \(5 \, \text{m}\) long makes an angle of \(60^\circ\) with the ground. Find the height it reaches on the wall.

1. **Identify the ratio**: \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\text{Opposite (height)}}{\text{Hypotenuse (ladder)}}\).
2. **Substitute known values**:
   \[
   \sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \text{Hypotenuse} = 5 \, \text{m}.
   \]
3. **Compute**:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\text{height}}{5} 
   \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{height} = 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2} \, \text{m}.
   \]

**Common Error**: Using \(\tan\) instead of \(\sin\). Always decide which ratio is appropriate based on known sides.

---

### **Solution 5 (Medium)**

**Problem:** In \(\triangle ABC\), right-angled at \(C\), if \(\angle A = 45^\circ\) and \(BC = 7 \, \text{cm}\), find \(AB\).

1. **Label the sides**: 
   - \(AC\) is opposite to \(\angle B\).
   - \(BC\) is opposite to \(\angle A = 45^\circ\).
   - \(AB\) is the hypotenuse.
2. **Use \(\sin 45^\circ\)**: 
   \[
   \sin 45^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
3. **Substitute**:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{7}{AB} 
   \quad \Rightarrow \quad AB = 7 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{14}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]
4. **Rationalize if needed**:
   \[
   AB = \frac{14}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} 
   = 7\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm}.
   \]

**Common Error**: Confusing which side is opposite or which ratio to use.

---

### **Solution 6 (Medium)**

**Problem:** If \(\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5}\), find \(\cos (90^\circ - \theta)\).

1. **Recall**: \(\cos (90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta\).
2. **Substitute**: \(\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5}\).
3. **Therefore**:
   \[
   \cos (90^\circ - \theta) = \frac{3}{5}.
   \]

**Common Error**: Misinterpreting complementary angles.

---

### **Solution 7 (Hard)**

**Problem:** A man on top of a building \(50 \, \text{m}\) high observes a car on the ground at an angle of depression of \(30^\circ\). The car drives towards the building until the angle of depression becomes \(45^\circ\). Find the distance the car has traveled.

1. **Set up the scenario**:

   ```
       (Top of building)
              M
              |
    50 m       |
              |
   Building    |_________C1_________ Car 1
              |         |\
              |         | \
              |         |  \ (Angle of depression = 30°)
              |         |   \
              |         |    \
              |         |_____C2_______ Car 2
              |               \
              |                \ (Angle of depression = 45°)
              |_________________\________ Ground
   ```

   - \(MC1\) = line of sight for \(30^\circ\).
   - \(MC2\) = line of sight for \(45^\circ\).

2. **Angle of elevation from ground**:  
   The angles of depression from the top are the same as angles of elevation from the car to the building (alternate interior angles).

3. **Let the distances be**:
   - \(C1B = x\) (horizontal distance from building base \(B\) to car’s first position).
   - \(C2B = y\) (horizontal distance from building base \(B\) to car’s second position).
   - Car traveled = \(x - y\).

4. **Use \(\tan\) ratio**:
   For the \(30^\circ\) position:
   \[
   \tan 30^\circ = \frac{50}{x}, 
   \quad \tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} 
   \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 50\sqrt{3}.
   \]

   For the \(45^\circ\) position:
   \[
   \tan 45^\circ = \frac{50}{y},
   \quad \tan 45^\circ = 1
   \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 50.
   \]

5. **Distance traveled**:
   \[
   x - y = 50\sqrt{3} - 50 = 50(\sqrt{3} - 1) \, \text{m}.
   \]

**Common Error**: Mixing up angle of depression with angle of elevation, forgetting they are equal alternate interior angles.

---

### **Solution 8 (Hard)**

**Problem:** Evaluate (and simplify) the following expression **without using a calculator**:
\[
\frac{\sin 45^\circ \cdot \cos 30^\circ + \tan 60^\circ}{\cot 30^\circ - \sec 45^\circ}.
\]

1. **Substitute known values**:
   \[
   \sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},
   \quad \tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3},
   \quad \cot 30^\circ = \sqrt{3},
   \quad \sec 45^\circ = \sqrt{2}.
   \]

2. **Evaluate numerator**:
   \[
   \sin 45^\circ \cdot \cos 30^\circ + \tan 60^\circ
   = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \sqrt{3}
   = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \sqrt{3}.
   \]

3. **Evaluate denominator**:
   \[
   \cot 30^\circ - \sec 45^\circ
   = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}.
   \]

4. **Combine**:
   \[
   \frac{\sin 45^\circ \cdot \cos 30^\circ + \tan 60^\circ}{\cot 30^\circ - \sec 45^\circ}
   = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}}.
   \]

5. **Rationalize or simplify step-by-step**:  

   First, express \(\sqrt{3}\) with a common denominator:
   \[
   \sqrt{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{4}.
   \]
   So numerator becomes:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{6} + 4\sqrt{3}}{4}.
   \]

   Thus the expression:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{\sqrt{6} + 4\sqrt{3}}{4}}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}}
   = \frac{\sqrt{6} + 4\sqrt{3}}{4(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})}.
   \]

   Multiply numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}\) to rationalize:

   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{6} + 4\sqrt{3}}{4(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})} \times
   \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}}
   = \frac{(\sqrt{6} + 4\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})}{4[(\sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2]}.
   \]

   Denominator simplifies to:
   \[
   4(3 - 2) = 4(1) = 4.
   \]

   So now we have:
   \[
   \frac{(\sqrt{6} + 4\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})}{4}.
   \]

   Expand the numerator (be systematic and careful with each term):
   \[
   (\sqrt{6})(\sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}, \quad
   (\sqrt{6})(\sqrt{2}) = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3},
   \]
   \[
   (4\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3}) = 4 \times 3 = 12, \quad
   (4\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{2}) = 4 \sqrt{6}.
   \]

   Summing all:
   \[
   = 3\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{3} + 12 + 4\sqrt{6}.
   \]

   Thus expression becomes:
   \[
   \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{3} + 12 + 4\sqrt{6}}{4}.
   \]

   You can leave it factored or split it into separate fractions:
   \[
   = \frac{12}{4} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{4\sqrt{6}}{4}
   = 3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \sqrt{6}.
   \]

**Common Error**: Failing to rationalize the denominator correctly or mixing up radical simplifications.
