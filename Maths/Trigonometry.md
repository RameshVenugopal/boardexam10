# Trigonometry Study Guide for ICSE Class 10

---

## 1. Key Concepts

* **Definition of Trigonometric Ratios**  
  In a right-angled triangle (with acute angle \(\theta\)):
  \[
  \sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad
  \cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad
  \tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjacent side}}
  \]
  
* **Reciprocal Identities**  
  \[
  \csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}, \quad
  \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}, \quad
  \cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}
  \]

* **Pythagorean Identities**  
  \[
  \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1, \quad
  1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta, \quad
  1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta
  \]

* **Standard Angles and Their Values**  

  | Angle (\(\theta\)) | \(\sin \theta\) | \(\cos \theta\) | \(\tan \theta\) |
  |--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
  | \(0^\circ\)        | 0               | 1               | 0               |
  | \(30^\circ\)       | \(\frac{1}{2}\) | \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) | \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) |
  | \(45^\circ\)       | \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) | \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) | 1               |
  | \(60^\circ\)       | \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) | \(\frac{1}{2}\) | \(\sqrt{3}\) |
  | \(90^\circ\)       | 1               | 0               | - (undefined)   |

* **Trigonometric Identities for Sum and Difference of Angles**  
  (Mostly required for advanced problem-solving and manipulations):
  \[
  \sin(A \pm B) = \sin A \cos B \pm \cos A \sin B
  \]  
  \[
  \cos(A \pm B) = \cos A \cos B \mp \sin A \sin B
  \]  
  \[
  \tan(A \pm B) = \frac{\tan A \pm \tan B}{1 \mp \tan A \tan B}
  \]

* **Applications in Heights and Distances**  
  - **Angle of Elevation**: The angle formed by the line of sight (from an observer looking upward) with the horizontal.  
  - **Angle of Depression**: The angle formed by the line of sight (from an observer looking downward) with the horizontal.  
  - Usually involves applying \(\tan \theta\) (sometimes \(\sin \theta\) or \(\cos \theta\)) in right-angled triangles formed by the horizontal and vertical measurements.

* **Key Tips**  
  - Always draw a neat diagram to identify which sides correspond to “opposite”, “adjacent”, and “hypotenuse.”  
  - Practice converting word problems into trigonometric equations.  
  - Remember to check if the problem requires you to work in degrees or radians (ICSE typically uses degrees at Class 10 level).

## 2. ICSE Exam-Focused Question Patterns (with Trend Analysis)

Over the past 20+ years of ICSE Class 10 Mathematics board exams, the following patterns have been observed in **Trigonometry**:

1. **Direct Application of Basic Trigonometric Ratios**  
   *Frequency Analysis:* Appears in almost every paper (at least 18 out of 20 years).  
   - Simple problems involving \(\sin, \cos, \tan\) of standard angles.  
   - Often 2- or 3-mark questions, testing basic recall and direct computation.

2. **Heights and Distances Problems (Angle of Elevation & Depression)**  
   *Frequency Analysis:* Common (appears in ~17 out of 20 papers).  
   - Typical scenario-based questions: find the height of a building, or the distance from a certain point, etc.  
   - Expect 4-mark or 5-mark problems requiring a clear diagram and multi-step solution.

3. **Use of Trigonometric Identities to Simplify Expressions**  
   *Frequency Analysis:* Appears in about 50% of the papers (around 10 out of 20).  
   - Requires manipulation of trig expressions, factorizing, or applying identities.  
   - Sometimes twisted with angle sum/differences.

4. **Combined Angle Problems**  
   *Frequency Analysis:* Less frequent (7 out of 20 papers).  
   - Involves sum and difference formulas or complementary angles.  
   - Some problems blend geometric theorems (e.g., circle geometry) with trig.

5. **Twists and Variations**  
   - Occasional questions mix geometry with trigonometry, e.g., proving a certain length or angle using a known identity.  
   - Graphical representations or special triangles might be included.

**Overall Trend**:  
- **Heights and Distances** + **Direct Ratio Calculations** consistently dominate.  
- **Simplification using Identities** is the next most common.  
- **Combined or advanced trigonometric identities** are less frequent but do appear, especially in more challenging or choice-based questions.

## 3. Graded Practice Questions (with Difficulty Levels)

Below are 12 practice questions divided into **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** levels. Try them in a timed environment to simulate exam conditions.

### 3.1 Easy Questions

1. **(Easy)** In a right triangle \(ABC\) (right-angled at \(B\)), if \(\angle A = 30^\circ\) and \(BC = 5\) cm, find \(AC\).  

2. **(Easy)** Evaluate:

   \]

3. **(Easy)** If \(\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5}\), find \(\cos \theta\) given \(\theta\) is acute.

4. **(Easy)** Prove the identity:

   \]

### 3.2 Medium Questions

   (Assume angles are in the first quadrant.)

### 3.3 Hard Questions

9. **(Hard)** A man observes the top of a building at an angle of elevation of \(60^\circ\). After walking 20 m away from the building, the angle of elevation is \(45^\circ\). Find the height of the building.  

10. **(Hard)** Prove that:  
    \[
    \tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin(A + B)}{\cos(A + B)}
    \]
    using the sum of angle formulas for \(\sin\) and \(\cos\), and then simplify to the standard identity  
    \[
    \tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.
    \]

11. **(Hard)** In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle Q = 90^\circ\). If \(\tan P = 2\) and \(\tan R = 3\), prove that the triangle cannot be right-angled. (Hint: Use the tangent values to express sides in a single variable and check for the Pythagorean theorem.)

12. **(Hard)** Two poles of heights 10 m and 20 m stand on the same level ground. If the line segment joining their tops makes a \(45^\circ\) angle with the horizontal, find the distance between the poles.

## 4. Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions (with Explanations and Common Errors)

Below are detailed solutions to the above questions. Study the step-by-step process carefully, noting common pitfalls.

---

### 4.1 Easy Questions

1. **(Easy)**  
   **Question**: In a right triangle \(ABC\) (right-angled at \(B\)), if \(\angle A = 30^\circ\) and \(BC = 5\) cm, find \(AC\).  

   **Solution**:
   1. Label the sides: let \(AB\) be opposite to \(\angle C\), \(BC\) be opposite \(\angle A\), and \(AC\) be the hypotenuse (since \(B\) is the right angle).  
   2. \(\angle A = 30^\circ\), so side \(BC\) is **opposite** to \(\angle A\).  
   3. By definition, \(\sin A = \sin 30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC}\).  
   4. Substitute known values: \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{AC}\).  
   5. Therefore, \(AC = 10\) cm.

   **Common Error**: Mixing up sides. Always confirm which side is opposite the angle in question.

---

2. **(Easy)**  
   **Question**: Evaluate \(\sin 45^\circ + \cos 60^\circ - \tan 30^\circ\).  

   **Solution**:
   1. Recall standard values:  
      \[
      \sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad 
      \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}, \quad
      \tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
      \]
   2. Substitute:  
      \[
      \sin 45^\circ + \cos 60^\circ - \tan 30^\circ 
      = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
      \]
   3. While you could combine into a single fraction, usually the final answer in simplest radical form is acceptable:  
      \[
      = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
      \]

   **Common Error**: Sometimes students try to rationalize or combine. Unless specifically required, leaving it in a simplified radical form is fine.

---

3. **(Easy)**  
   **Question**: If \(\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5}\), find \(\cos \theta\), given \(\theta\) is acute.  

   **Solution**:
   1. Use the Pythagorean identity: \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).  
   2. \(\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5} \implies \sin^2 \theta = \frac{9}{25}\).  
   3. Hence, \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{9}{25} = \frac{16}{25}\).  
   4. Because \(\theta\) is acute, \(\cos \theta > 0\). Thus, \(\cos \theta = \frac{4}{5}\).

   **Common Error**: Forgetting to consider the sign of \(\cos \theta\). For acute angles, \(\cos \theta\) is always positive.

---

4. **(Easy)**  
   **Question**: Prove the identity:  
   \[
   \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{1 - \cos \theta} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{1 - \sin \theta} = \sin \theta + \cos \theta.
   \]

   **Solution** (One of the simplest approaches):
   1. Rewrite \(\sin^2 \theta\) as \(\sin \theta \cdot \sin \theta\), and similarly for \(\cos^2 \theta\).  
   2. Notice that \(1 - \cos \theta = (1 - \cos \theta)\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} = \frac{1 - \cos^2 \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} = \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}\).  
   3. Thus, \(\frac{\sin^2 \theta}{1 - \cos \theta} = \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} \cdot (1 + \cos \theta) = \sin \theta (1 + \cos \theta) / \sin \theta \) if approached carefully. Alternatively, you can do direct factorization.  
   4. Perform similar manipulation for the second fraction.  
   5. After simplification, you should arrive at \(\sin \theta + \cos \theta\).

   **Common Error**: Missing algebraic factorization or mixing up numerator/denominator. Always handle factorization step-by-step.

---

### 4.2 Medium Questions

5. **(Medium)**  
   **Question**: A tower stands on level ground. At a point 20 m away from the base of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is \(30^\circ\). Find the height of the tower.  

   **Solution**:
   1. Let the height of the tower be \(h\). Draw a right triangle where the vertical side is the tower (height \(h\)), and the horizontal side is 20 m.  
   2. \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{h}{20}\).  
   3. Use standard value: \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\).  
   4. So, \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{20}\).  
   5. Hence, \(h = \frac{20}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{20\sqrt{3}}{3}\) m. (Rationalize if needed.)  

   **Common Error**: Not drawing the diagram or mixing up “adjacent” with “opposite” side.

---

6. **(Medium)**  
   **Question**: Simplify the expression: \(\sec^2 \theta - \tan^2 \theta\). Then evaluate it for \(\theta = 45^\circ\).  

   **Solution**:
   1. Recall the Pythagorean identity: \(\sec^2 \theta - \tan^2 \theta = 1\).  
   2. Therefore, \(\sec^2 \theta - \tan^2 \theta = 1\) for any angle \(\theta\).  
   3. Substitute \(\theta = 45^\circ\). The expression is simply \(1\).

   **Common Error**: Sometimes students expand \(\sec^2 \theta\) as \(1/\cos^2 \theta\) and \(\tan^2 \theta\) as \(\sin^2 \theta / \cos^2 \theta\) incorrectly. Using the known identity is faster and less prone to error.

---

7. **(Medium)**  
   **Question**: In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle B = 90^\circ\). If \(\sin A = \frac{4}{5}\), find the ratio of the sides \(BC : AB : AC\).  

   **Solution**:
   1. \(\sin A = \frac{4}{5}\) means \(\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite to }A}{\text{hypotenuse}}\).  
   2. In \(\triangle ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), side \(AC\) is the hypotenuse. If \(A\) is at vertex \(A\), the opposite side is \(BC\).  
   3. So, \(\frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{4}{5}\). Let \(BC = 4k\) and \(AC = 5k\).  
   4. Then, \(AB\) (the remaining side) must satisfy Pythagoras: \((AB)^2 + (BC)^2 = (AC)^2\). Hence, \((AB)^2 = (5k)^2 - (4k)^2 = 25k^2 - 16k^2 = 9k^2\).  
   5. So, \(AB = 3k\).  
   6. Ratio \(BC : AB : AC = 4k : 3k : 5k = 4 : 3 : 5\).

   **Common Error**: Placing sides incorrectly. Always confirm which angle is right-angled, which side is opposite that angle, etc.

---

8. **(Medium)**  
   **Question**: If \(\tan x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(\cos y = \frac{1}{2}\), find \(\sin(x + y)\). Assume angles are in the first quadrant.  

   **Solution**:
   1. \(\tan x = \sqrt{3}\) implies \(x = 60^\circ\) (in the first quadrant).  
   2. \(\cos y = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(y = 60^\circ\) (in the first quadrant).  
   3. \(\sin(x + y) = \sin(60^\circ + 60^\circ) = \sin(120^\circ)\).  
   4. \(\sin(120^\circ) = \sin(180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).  

   **Common Error**: Confusing the sign of \(\sin(120^\circ)\). In the range \(90^\circ\) to \(180^\circ\), \(\sin\) is positive.

---

### 4.3 Hard Questions

9. **(Hard)**  
   **Question**: A man observes the top of a building at an angle of elevation of \(60^\circ\). After walking 20 m away from the building, the angle of elevation is \(45^\circ\). Find the height of the building.  

   **Solution**:
   1. Let \(h\) be the height of the building. Let the initial distance from the building be \(d\).  
   2. From the first position: \(\tan 60^\circ = \frac{h}{d} \implies \sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{d} \implies h = \sqrt{3} \, d.\)  
   3. After walking 20 m away, the distance from the building is \(d + 20\). Then \(\tan 45^\circ = \frac{h}{d + 20}\).  
   4. \(\tan 45^\circ = 1\), so \(h = d + 20\).  
   5. Substitute \(h\) from step (2) into this: \(\sqrt{3} \, d = d + 20\).  
   6. Rearrange: \(\sqrt{3} \, d - d = 20 \implies d(\sqrt{3} - 1) = 20\).  
   7. \(d = \frac{20}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\). Rationalize if necessary:
      \[
      d = \frac{20(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} 
      = \frac{20(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} 
      = \frac{20(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} 
      = 10(\sqrt{3} + 1).
      \]
   8. Hence, \(h = \sqrt{3} \, d = \sqrt{3} \times 10(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 10(3 + \sqrt{3}) = 30 + 10\sqrt{3}\).  
   9. So, the building’s height \( = 30 + 10\sqrt{3}\) m.

   **Common Error**: Mixing up which distance changes by 20 m. The distance from the building after walking away is \(d + 20\), not \(20 - d\).

---

10. **(Hard)**  
   **Question**: Prove that:  
   \[
   \tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin(A + B)}{\cos(A + B)},
   \]
   using the sum of angle formulas, then simplify to  
   \[
   \tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.
   \]

   **Solution**:
   1. Write \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\cos(A + B)\) using sum formulas:  
      \[
      \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B, 
      \]
      \[
      \cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
      \]
   2. Then,  
      \[
      \tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin(A + B)}{\cos(A + B)} 
      = \frac{\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B}.
      \]
   3. Divide numerator and denominator by \(\cos A \cos B\):  
      \[
      = \frac{\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} + \frac{\sin B}{\cos B}}{1 - \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\cdot \frac{\sin B}{\cos B}}
      = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.
      \]

   **Common Error**: Forgetting to divide both numerator and denominator correctly. Each term must be divided by \(\cos A \cos B\).

---

11. **(Hard)**  
   **Question**: In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle Q = 90^\circ\). If \(\tan P = 2\) and \(\tan R = 3\), prove that the triangle cannot be right-angled.  

   **Solution** (Outline):
   1. In \(\triangle PQR\) with \(\angle Q = 90^\circ\), sides would be \(PQ\), \(QR\), and \(PR\). Let \(PQ\) be adjacent to \(\angle P\), so \(\tan P = \frac{QR}{PQ}\).  
   2. Similarly, \(\tan R = \frac{PQ}{QR}\).  
   3. \(\tan P = 2\) means \(\frac{QR}{PQ} = 2\). Let \(QR = 2k\) and \(PQ = k\).  
   4. \(\tan R = 3\) means \(\frac{PQ}{QR} = 3\). Substituting the same \(QR\) and \(PQ\) gives \(\frac{k}{2k} = 3\), which implies \(\frac{1}{2} = 3\). Contradiction!  
   5. Hence, such a configuration is impossible.

   **Common Error**: Trying to directly use Pythagoras. Instead, it’s simpler to show the tangents lead to contradictory side ratios.

---

12. **(Hard)**  
   **Question**: Two poles of heights 10 m and 20 m stand on the same level ground. If the line segment joining their tops makes a \(45^\circ\) angle with the horizontal, find the distance between the poles.  

   **Solution**:
   1. Let the distance between the poles (on the ground) be \(d\).  
   2. The vertical difference between tops is \(20 - 10 = 10\) m.  
   3. Draw a diagram: the 10 m pole, the 20 m pole, and a line joining the tops at \(\theta = 45^\circ\).  
   4. In the horizontal-vertical plane, you have a right triangle where the horizontal side is \(d\) and the vertical side is \(10\) (the difference in heights). The segment between the pole tops is the hypotenuse.  
   5. The line segment is at \(45^\circ\) to the horizontal, so \(\tan 45^\circ = 1 = \frac{\text{vertical difference}}{\text{horizontal distance}}\).  
   6. Therefore, \(1 = \frac{10}{d} \implies d = 10\) m.  

   **Common Error**: Mixing up which height to use. You must consider the difference in height because the segment is between the **tops** of the poles.

## 5. Concise Summary and Key Takeaways (for Quick Revision)

* **Key Ratios**:  
  \[
  \sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad
  \cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad
  \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}.
  \]
* **Standard Values**: Memorize \(\sin, \cos, \tan\) for \(0^\circ, 30^\circ, 45^\circ, 60^\circ, 90^\circ\).  
* **Pythagorean Identities**:  
  \[
  \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1, \quad
  \sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta, \quad
  \csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta.
  \]
* **Heights & Distances**:  
  - Always draw a sketch.  
  - Use \(\tan \theta\) primarily for angle of elevation/depression problems.  
* **Sum & Difference Formulas**: Useful for advanced manipulation:  
  \[
  \sin(A \pm B) = \sin A \cos B \pm \cos A \sin B, \quad
  \cos(A \pm B) = \cos A \cos B \mp \sin A \sin B.
  \]
  \[
  \tan(A \pm B) = \frac{\tan A \pm \tan B}{1 \mp \tan A \tan B}.
  \]
* **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Mixing up opposite/adjacent sides in right triangles.  
  - Using the wrong angle to set up \(\sin, \cos, \tan\).  
  - Forgetting to consider sign (+/-) in different quadrants (though in Class 10, typically angles are acute or between \(0^\circ\) and \(90^\circ\)).  
  - Overlooking the difference between “distance from” vs. “distance walked.”

**Final Advice**:  
1. Practice drawing a clear diagram for every trigonometry problem.  
2. Memorize standard angles and key identities.  
3. When in doubt, revert to the definitions and Pythagoras to verify correctness.  
4. Time yourself while practicing past ICSE papers to build exam confidence.
