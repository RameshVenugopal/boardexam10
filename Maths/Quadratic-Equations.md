# Problems on Quadratic Equations - ICSE Class 10 Guide

## 1. Key Formulas

### Basic Formulas:
- **Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation:**
  \[
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0, \quad a \neq 0
  \]
- **Quadratic Formula:**
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]
- **Discriminant:**
  \[
  D = b^2 - 4ac
  \]
  - If \( D > 0 \), two real and distinct roots exist.
  - If \( D = 0 \), two real and equal roots exist.
  - If \( D < 0 \), no real roots exist (complex roots).

### Factorization Method:
- **Roots from Factoring:**
  \[
  ax^2 + bx + c = a(x - p)(x - q)
  \]
  where \( p \) and \( q \) are the roots of the equation.

### Relationships Between Roots and Coefficients:
- **Sum of Roots:**
  \[
  \alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}
  \]
- **Product of Roots:**
  \[
  \alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}
  \]

### Methods to Solve:
- **Factorization Method** (when the quadratic equation can be factored easily).
- **Quadratic Formula** (when factorization is difficult).
- **Completing the Square** (useful for deriving the quadratic formula and for certain types of equations).

## 2. Common Question Patterns

### Most Frequent Types of Questions:
- **Direct Questions** (solving quadratic equations using the quadratic formula or factorization).
  - Example: Solve \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).
- **Application-based Questions** (word problems leading to quadratic equations).
  - Example: A rectangleâ€™s length is 2 meters more than its breadth. If the area is 80 square meters, find the dimensions.
- **Reasoning Questions** (based on relationships between roots and coefficients).
  - Example: Given the sum and product of the roots, find the quadratic equation.
- **Factorization Method** (solving equations by factoring).
  - Example: Factor and solve \( 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0 \).
- **Completing the Square** (deriving roots through the method of completing the square).
  - Example: Solve \( x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0 \) by completing the square.

### Sub-topics Likely to be Tested:
- Factorization method
- Solving by quadratic formula

## 4. Detailed Solutions

### Solution to Question 1:
**Equation:** \( x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 \)

- Using the quadratic formula:
  \[
  x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 20}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{4 \pm 6}{2}
  \]
  Thus, \( x = \frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5 \) or \( x = \frac{4 - 6}{2} = -1 \).

**Roots:** \( x = 5, -1 \)

### Solution to Question 2:
**Equation:** \( 2x^2 - 3x - 5 = 0 \)

- We need to factor the equation:
  - First, multiply \( 2 \times (-5) = -10 \).
  - Find two numbers whose product is -10 and sum is -3. These numbers are -5 and 2.
  - Rewriting the middle term: 
    \[
    2x^2 - 5x + 2x - 5 = 0
    \]
    \[
    x(2x - 5) + 1(2x - 5) = 0
    \]
    \[
    (x + 1)(2x - 5) = 0
    \]
    Thus, \( x = -1 \) or \( x = \frac{5}{2} \).
