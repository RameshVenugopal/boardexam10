Quadratic Equations Study Guide for ICSE Class 10
Key Concepts
Definition: A quadratic equation is an equation of the form 
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
, where 
a \neq 0
.
Roots of Quadratic Equations: The solutions or roots of the equation can be found using:
Factorization Method
Quadratic Formula: 
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
Nature of Roots: Determined by the discriminant 
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
:
If 
\Delta > 0
, roots are real and distinct.
If 
\Delta = 0
, roots are real and equal.
If 
\Delta < 0
, roots are complex (imaginary).
Sum and Product of Roots: For 
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
, the sum of the roots 
\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}
, and product 
\alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}
.

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Easy Questions
1. Solve for 
x
: 
x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0

Step 1: Factorize the equation: 
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
Step 2: Solve each factor for 
x
:
x - 2 = 0
 gives 
x = 2
x - 3 = 0
 gives 
x = 3
Common Error: Forgetting to check all factors.

2. Factorize: 
x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0

Step 1: Look for factors of -8 that add to +2, which are +4 and -2.
Step 2: Write 
x^2 + 2x - 8 = (x + 4)(x - 2) = 0
Step 3: Solve for 
x
: 
x = -4
 or 
x = 2
Common Error: Incorrect factor selection.

3. Find the roots: Using the quadratic formula for 
2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0

Step 1: Identify 
a = 2
, 
b = -7
, 
c = 3
.
Step 2: Apply the formula 
x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot 2}
Step 3: Solve to get 
x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 24}}{4} = \frac{7 \pm 5}{4}
Step 4: Roots are 
x = 3
 or 
x = \frac{1}{2}
Common Error: Miscalculation of the discriminant or division.
