## Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions

### **Easy**

**1. Volume of a Cube:**
   - Formula: \( V = a^3 \)
   - Calculation: \( V = 5^3 = 125 \, cm^3 \)
   - **Common Error**: Forgetting to cube the side length.

**2. Surface Area of a Cylinder:**
   - Formula for TSA: \( 2\pi rh + 2\pi r^2 \)
   - Calculation: \( 2\pi(3)(7) + 2\pi(3)^2 = 42\pi + 18\pi = 60\pi \, cm^2 \)
   - **Common Error**: Confusing CSA with TSA.

**3. Volume of a Sphere:**
   - Formula: \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
   - Calculation: \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (2)^3 = \frac{32}{3} \pi \, cm^3 \)
   - **Common Error**: Incorrectly using the formula or miscalculating the cube of the radius.

### **Medium**

**4. Volume of Cylindrical Tank:**
   - Calculation: \( V = \pi (5)^2 (10) = 250\pi \, cm^3 \)
   - **Common Error**: Misplacing the radius in the formula.

**5. Reshaping Cone into Sphere:**
   - Volume of cone = Volume of sphere; \( \frac{1}{3} \pi (6)^2 (8) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
   - Solving for \( r \): \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{288}{4}} = 3\sqrt[3]{2} \, cm \)
   - **Common Error**: Not equating volumes correctly or solving for radius.

**6. Surface Area of Cone:**
   - Calculation: \( SA = \pi (6)(10) + \pi (6)^2 = 60\pi + 36\pi = 96\pi \, cm^2 \)
   - **Common Error**: Mixing up the slant height with the height.

**7. Volume of Dome + Cylinder:**
   - Volume of hemisphere: \( \frac{2}{3} \pi (7)^3 \)
   - Volume of cylinder: \( \pi (7)^2 (10) \)
   - Total Volume: \( \frac{686}{3} \pi + 490\pi = 749\pi \, cm^3 \)
   - **Common Error**: Adding the volumes without considering the correct formulas.

### **Hard**

**8. Sphere to Cones:**
   - Sphere volume: \( \frac{4}{3} \pi (9)^3 = 972\pi \, cm^3 \)
   - Since 3 cones, each cone volume: \( \frac{972\pi}{3} = 324\pi \, cm^3 \)
   - Solving for radius of cone: \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 (20) = 324\pi \), hence \( r = 6 \, cm \)

**9. Frustum Volume and TSA:**
   - Volume: Use frustum formula or subtract smaller cone from larger
   - TSA: Sum of areas of both ends, lateral area of frustum
   - **Common Error**: Miscalculation in frustum formulas, especially in lateral area.

**10. Proof for Cone Volume:**
   - Use geometry to show the relationship between the volumes of the original cone and its smaller part.

## Concise Summary and Key Takeaways
