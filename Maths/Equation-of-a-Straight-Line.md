ICSE Class 10 Maths Study Guide: Equation of a Straight Line
Key Concepts
Equation of a Line: 
Slope-Intercept Form: 
y = mx + c
, where 
m
 is the slope and 
c
 is the y-intercept.
Point-Slope Form: 
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
, for a line passing through point 
(x_1, y_1)
 with slope 
m
.
Two-Point Form: 
\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
 for a line passing through points 
(x_1, y_1)
 and 
(x_2, y_2)
.
Intercept Form: 
\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1
, where 
a
 and 
b
 are x-intercept and y-intercept respectively.
Slope: 
Slope 
m = \tan \theta
 where 
\theta
 is the angle of inclination.
Slope between two points 
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
.
Parallel and Perpendicular Lines:
Parallel lines have equal slopes (
m_1 = m_2
).
Perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is -1 (
m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1
).

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Question 1:
Solution: 
Using the slope-intercept form 
y = mx + c
, where 
m = 3
 and 
c = 2
, we get:
y = 3x + 2
Explanation: Directly apply the given slope and y-intercept into the equation.

Question 2:
Solution: 
Slope 
m = \frac{4 - 2}{3 - (-1)} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
.
Explanation: Use the formula for slope between two points. 
Common Error: Miscalculating the change in x or y.

Question 3:
Solution: 
Rearrange to y-intercept form: 
3y = -2x + 6
, thus 
y = -\frac{2}{3}x + 2
. The y-intercept is 2.
Explanation: Convert to slope-intercept form to find y-intercept directly.
Common Error: Forgetting to solve for y.

Question 4:
Solution: 
Slope of given line = 
\frac{3}{4}
. Hence, the parallel line has the same slope, leading to 
y - 2 = \frac{3}{4}(x - 1)
, or 
y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{5}{4}
.
Explanation: Match slopes for parallel lines.

Question 5:
Solution: 
Midpoint: 
\left(\frac{2+5}{2}, \frac{3+7}{2}\right) = (3.5, 5)
.
Slope of AB = 
\frac{7-3}{5-2} = \frac{4}{3}
. Perpendicular slope = 
-\frac{3}{4}
.
Equation: 
y - 5 = -\frac{3}{4}(x - 3.5)
.
Explanation: Use midpoint formula and perpendicularity condition.

Question 6:
Solution: 
Slope of given line = 3, so slope of perpendicular line = 
-\frac{1}{3}
. Since y-intercept is 2, equation is:
y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2
Explanation: Use slope relationship between perpendicular lines.

Question 7:
Solution: 
Intersection with y-axis: 
x = 0 \Rightarrow y = -1
. Line through origin and (-1, 0) has equation:
y = x
Explanation: Use the point-slope form for a line through the origin.

Question 8:
Solution: 
Midpoint = 
\left(\frac{1+4}{2}, \frac{2+6}{2}\right) = (2.5, 4)
.
Slope of segment = 
\frac{6-2}{4-1} = \frac{4}{3}
. Perpendicular slope = 
-\frac{3}{4}
.
Equation: 
y - 4 = -\frac{3}{4}(x - 2.5)
.

Question 9:
Solution: 
Solve simultaneously for intersection. Then use that point and perpendicularity to find new line's equation.

Question 10:
Solution: 
Use substitution or elimination to find intersection points and prove concurrency.
