# Chapter: Equation of a Straight Line - ICSE Class 10

## 1. Key Formulas

- **Slope-Intercept Form**:

  where:  
  - \( m \) is the slope of the line  
  - \( c \) is the y-intercept (the point where the line intersects the y-axis)

- **Point-Slope Form**:  
  \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \)  
  where:  
  - \( m \) is the slope  
  - \( (x_1, y_1) \) is a point on the line

- **Two-Point Form**:  
  \( \frac{y - y_1}{y_2 - y_1} = \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} \)  
  where:  
  - \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are two points on the line

- **Intercept Form**:  
  \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \)  
  where:  
  - \( a \) is the x-intercept  
  - \( b \) is the y-intercept

- **General Form**:  
  \( Ax + By + C = 0 \)  
  where:  
  - \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are constants

- **Slope of a Line**:  
  \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \)  
  where \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are two points on the line.

## 4. Detailed Solutions

### Solution to Question 1:
**Given**: Points (1, 2) and (3, 4).  
**Formula**:  
Slope, \( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{4 - 2}{3 - 1} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \).

**Equation**:  
Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \),  
\( y - 2 = 1(x - 1) \).  
Simplifying,  
\( y - 2 = x - 1 \).  
Thus, the equation of the line is \( y = x + 1 \).

### Solution to Question 2:
**Given**: Equation \( 2x - 3y + 6 = 0 \).  
Rearrange the equation to slope-intercept form:  
\( 2x - 3y = -6 \).  
\( -3y = -2x - 6 \).  
\( y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2 \).

Thus, the slope \( m = \frac{2}{3} \) and the y-intercept \( c = 2 \).

### Solution to Question 3:
**Given**: Point (2, 3) and slope 4.  
Using the point-slope form:  
\( y - 3 = 4(x - 2) \).  
Simplifying:  
\( y - 3 = 4x - 8 \).  
Thus, the equation of the line is \( y = 4x - 5 \).

### Solution to Question 4:
**Given**: Equation \( 3x + 4y - 12 = 0 \).  
For the x-intercept, set \( y = 0 \):  
\( 3x - 12 = 0 \) → \( x = 4 \).  
For the y-intercept, set \( x = 0 \):  
\( 4y - 12 = 0 \) → \( y = 3 \).  
Thus, the x-intercept is 4 and the y-intercept is 3.

### Solution to Question 5:
**Given**: Lines \( 2x - y + 4 = 0 \) and \( 3x + 2y - 5 = 0 \).  
The slopes of the lines are:  
- For the first line: \( m_1 = \frac{2}{1} = 2 \).  
- For the second line: \( m_2 = \frac{-3}{2} \).  
Since the product of the slopes \( m_1 \times m_2 = -1 \), the lines are perpendicular.

### Solution to Question 6:
**Given**: Point (1, 1) and slope -2.  
Using the point-slope form:  
\( y - 1 = -2(x - 1) \).  
Simplifying:  
\( y - 1 = -2x + 2 \).  
Thus, the equation of the line is \( y = -2x + 3 \).

### Solution to Question 7:
**Given**: Points (-1, 4) and (3, -2).  
Slope:  
\( m = \frac{-2 - 4}{3 + 1} = \frac{-6}{4} = -\frac{3}{2} \).

Using the point-slope form with point (-1, 4):  
\( y - 4 = -\frac{3}{2}(x + 1) \).  
Simplifying:  
\( y - 4 = -\frac{3}{2}x - \frac{3}{2} \).  
Thus, the equation is \( y = -\frac{3}{2}x + \frac{5}{2} \).

### Solution to Question 8:
**Given**: Points (0, 0) and (4, 5).  
Slope:  
\( m = \frac{5 - 0}{4 - 0} = \frac{5}{4} \).

## 5. Summary

The equation of a straight line can be expressed in various forms, such as slope-intercept, point-slope, and general form. The key concept is understanding the relationship between the slope and points on the line, as well as how to derive and manipulate these equations to solve different problems. Mastery of the formulas and their applications is crucial for tackling problems in this chapter.

## 6. Practice Tips

- Focus on deriving equations from given points and slopes using different forms.
- Practice solving for slope and intercept from the general form of the equation.
- Review graph-based questions and ensure you can find intercepts and sketch lines accurately.
- Work on application-based questions where you are required to derive equations from real-life contexts (e.g., word problems).
