# Tangent Properties - ICSE Class 10 Maths Guide

## 1. Key Formulas

### Tangent and Circle Theorems:
- **Tangent to a Circle**: A tangent to a circle is a straight line that touches the circle at exactly one point.
- **Tangent Property**: The tangent at any point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.
- **Angle Between Two Tangents**: If two tangents are drawn from an external point to a circle, the angle between them is equal to the angle subtended by the line joining the external point to the center of the circle at the center.
  - Formula: 
    \[
    \angle AOB = 2 \times \angle PQR
    \]
    where \( A \) and \( B \) are points of tangency and \( O \) is the center of the circle.
- **Equal Tangents**: Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length.
  \[
  \text{AP} = \text{PB}
  \]
  where \( P \) is the external point and \( A \), \( B \) are the points of tangency.

### Important Theorems:
- **The Angle Between the Chord and the Tangent**: The angle between a chord and a tangent at the point of contact is equal to the angle subtended by the chord at the opposite end of the circle.
  \[
  \angle PQR = \angle PPR
  \]
- **Secant and Tangent Theorem**: If a secant and a tangent are drawn from an external point to a circle, then the square of the length of the tangent is equal to the product of the lengths of the two segments of the secant.
  \[
  PT^2 = PA \times PB
  \]

## 2. Common Question Patterns

### Based on the last 10 years of ICSE Class 10 board exams, the following question patterns are common:
- **Direct Questions** (Formula-based):
  - Prove that the angle between the tangent and the radius at the point of contact is 90°.
  - Find the length of the tangent from an external point to a circle.
- **Application-Based Questions**:
  - Given a circle with a tangent, find the angle between the tangent and the chord.
  - Use the properties of tangents to find the length of the tangent or angles.
- **Reasoning and Proof-Based Questions**:
  - Prove that the tangents from an external point to a circle are equal in length.
  - Prove that the angle between two tangents drawn from an external point is supplementary to the central angle.

## 3. Sample Questions

### Question 1: Direct Formula Application
**Q**: In a circle, the radius is 5 cm. Find the length of the tangent from a point 12 cm away from the center of the circle.

### Question 2: Angle Between Tangents
**Q**: Two tangents are drawn from an external point \( P \) to a circle with center \( O \). If the angle between the tangents is 60°, find the angle subtended at the center of the circle.

### Question 3: Angle Between Chord and Tangent
**Q**: In the given circle, \( AB \) is a chord and \( OT \) is a tangent at \( A \). If \( \angle OAT = 40° \), find \( \angle OBA \).

### Question 4: Length of Tangent (Secant and Tangent Theorem)
**Q**: From an external point \( P \), a secant \( PA \) and a tangent \( PT \) are drawn to a circle. If \( PA = 10 \, \text{cm} \) and \( PT = 6 \, \text{cm} \), find the length of \( PB \).

### Question 5: Prove Tangents are Equal
**Q**: Prove that tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length.

### Question 6: Circle and Tangent Theorem
**Q**: If the tangent at \( A \) of a circle with center \( O \) makes an angle of 60° with the radius \( OA \), find the angle between the radius \( OA \) and the tangent at \( A \).

## 4. Detailed Solutions

### Solution 1: Length of Tangent from External Point
- Given radius \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \) and distance from center \( d = 12 \, \text{cm} \).
- Using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Length of tangent} = \sqrt{d^2 - r^2}
  \]
  \[
  = \sqrt{12^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{144 - 25} = \sqrt{119} \approx 10.91 \, \text{cm}
  \]

### Solution 2: Angle Between Tangents
- Given that the angle between the tangents is 60°, the angle subtended at the center is:
  \[
  \text{Angle at center} = 2 \times 60° = 120°
  \]

### Solution 3: Angle Between Chord and Tangent
- Since \( \angle OAT = 40° \), the angle \( \angle OBA \) is supplementary to \( \angle OAT \), so:
  \[
  \angle OBA = 90° - 40° = 50°
  \]

### Solution 4: Secant and Tangent Theorem
- From the Secant and Tangent Theorem:
  \[
  PT^2 = PA \times PB
  \]
  \[
  6^2 = 10 \times PB
  \]
  \[
  36 = 10 \times PB \Rightarrow PB = \frac{36}{10} = 3.6 \, \text{cm}
  \]

### Solution 5: Proof of Equal Tangents
- Let \( PA \) and \( PB \) be the tangents from external point \( P \) to the circle. By the tangent properties, the two tangents from an external point to a circle are equal in length, i.e., \( PA = PB \).

### Solution 6: Angle Between Radius and Tangent
- The angle between the radius \( OA \) and the tangent \( OT \) is always 90°, by the tangent property.

## 5. Summary
The **Tangent Properties** chapter primarily deals with the geometric properties and theorems related to tangents to circles. The key concepts include:
- Tangents are perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact.
- Two tangents drawn from an external point are equal in length.
- The angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord at the opposite end of the circle.
- The relationship between secants and tangents from an external point.

## 6. Practice Tips
- **Focus on Practice**: Regularly solve problems involving the application of tangent properties, especially those related to secant and tangent relations.
- **Understand Proofs**: Practice proving the properties, such as equal tangents from an external point, and understanding why these properties hold.
- **Work on Diagrams**: Draw accurate diagrams to visualize problems clearly, as they are crucial for solving geometry problems.
- **Formula Recall**: Memorize key formulas, such as those involving angles between tangents, and secant-tangent relations.
- **Practice Past Papers**: Solve past board exam questions to get a better understanding of question patterns.
