# Angle and Cyclic Properties (ICSE Class 10)

## 1. Key Formulas

### Angle Properties of Circles:
- **Angle subtended by a chord at the center**:
  - Angle at the center = 2 × Angle at the circumference subtended by the same chord.
  
- **Angle subtended by a chord at the circumference**:
  - The angle subtended by a chord at the circumference on the same side of the chord is constant (Angle subtended by same chord at the circumference = 1/2 × Angle at the center).

- **Cyclic Quadrilateral**:
  - The sum of the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180°.
    - ∠A + ∠C = 180° (for quadrilateral ABCD)

- **Angle in a semicircle**:
  - An angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference is always a right angle (90°).

- **Angle between two tangents**:
  - The angle between two tangents drawn from an external point is equal to the angle subtended by the chord joining the points of contact at the center.

- **Alternate Segment Theorem**:
  - The angle between a tangent and a chord drawn at the point of contact is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment.

## 4. Detailed Solutions

### Solution to Sample Question 1:
**Given**: Angle at center = 80°  
We know that the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference.  
So, Angle at circumference = 80° / 2 = **40°**.

### Solution to Sample Question 2:
**Given**: ∠A = 50°, ∠C = 120°  
Using the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:  
∠A + ∠C = 180°  
So, ∠B + ∠D = 180°  
Now, ∠B + ∠D = 180° - (50° + 120°) = **110°**.

### Solution to Sample Question 3:
**Given**: A diameter AB subtends a right angle at the circumference.  
By the property of circles, the angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference is always a right angle (90°).  
Thus, ∠ACB = **90°**.

### Solution to Sample Question 4:
**Given**: ∠APB = 40°  
Using the property of tangents, ∠AOB = 2 × ∠APB = 2 × 40° = **80°**.

### Solution to Sample Question 5:
**Given**: ∠A = 90°, ∠C = 80°  
Using the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:  
∠A + ∠C = 180°  
So, ∠B + ∠D = 180° - 90° - 80° = **10°**.

### Solution to Sample Question 6:
**Given**: Angle between tangents = 100°  
By the property of tangents, the angle between the tangents is equal to the angle subtended by the chord at the center.  
So, the angle at the center = **100°**.

### Solution to Sample Question 7:
**Given**: Two tangents are drawn from an external point P to a circle.  
By the property of tangents from an external point, the lengths of the tangents are equal.  
Thus, PA = PB.

### Solution to Sample Question 8:
**Given**: Angle between chord and tangent = 30°  
By the alternate segment theorem, the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment is equal to the angle between the chord and tangent.  
So, the angle = **30°**.
