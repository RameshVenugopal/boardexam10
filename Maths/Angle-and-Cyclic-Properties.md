Study Guide for ICSE Class 10 Maths - Angle and Cyclic Properties
Key Concepts
Angle Subtended by an Arc: 
An angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference.
Theorem: ∠AOB = 2∠ACB, where AOB is the central angle and ACB is the angle at the circumference.
Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties:
Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to 180°.
Theorem: ∠A + ∠C = 180° and ∠B + ∠D = 180°.
Angles in the Same Segment: 
Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.
Theorem: If ∠PAB and ∠PBC are in the same segment, then ∠PAB = ∠PBC.
Tangent and Radius: 
The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact.
Theorem: If OT is a radius and PQ is a tangent at T, then OT ⊥ PQ.
Intersecting Chords: 
When two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal.
Theorem: If AB and CD intersect at P, then AP × PB = CP × PD.

Graded Practice Questions

Q2 (Easy): If ∠AOB = 120° in a circle, find the angle subtended by arc AB at any point on the circumference.
Q3 (Easy): In a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, if ∠A = 50°, what is ∠C?

Medium Questions
Q4 (Medium): Given that PQ is a tangent to a circle at Q and OQ is the radius, prove that ∠OQP = 90°.
Q5 (Medium): In a circle, if AB and CD are two chords intersecting at P, and AB = 10 cm, AP = 4 cm, and CP = 5 cm, find the length of CD.
Q6 (Medium): In cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, if ∠B = 70° and ∠C = 110°, find ∠A and ∠D.
Q7 (Medium): Prove that if two circles touch each other externally, the point of contact lies on the straight line joining their centers.

Hard Questions
Q8 (Hard): Four points A, B, C, D are concyclic. If AB is tangent to another smaller circle at point E and AD is tangent at F, prove that EF is parallel to BC.
Q9 (Hard): In a circle, AB is a chord of length 8 cm, and a perpendicular from the center O to AB is 3 cm. Find the radius of the circle and the length of the arc AB if the angle AOB is known.

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Q1 (Easy):
Solution:
By the property of angles in the same segment, we know that all angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Therefore, if arc AB subtends ∠ACB and ∠ADB at points C and D respectively, then ∠ACB = ∠ADB.

Common Error: 
Confusing angles subtended by different arcs.

Q2 (Easy):
Solution:
Since the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that at the circumference, if ∠AOB = 120°, the angle at the circumference subtended by arc AB is 120° / 2 = 60°.

Common Error: 
Not halving the central angle for the angle at the circumference.

Q3 (Easy):
Solution:
In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180°. Thus, if ∠A = 50°, then ∠C must be 180° - 50° = 130°.

Common Error:
Incorrectly applying the supplementary angle property.

Q4 (Medium):
Solution:
Since the tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point, ∠OQP must be 90° by definition.

Common Error:
Not recognizing the perpendicular relationship between radius and tangent.

Q5 (Medium):
Solution:
Using the intersecting chord theorem, AP × PB = CP × PD. Here, PB = AB - AP = 10 - 4 = 6 cm. Thus, 4 × 6 = 5 × PD, giving PD = 4.8 cm. Therefore, CD = CP + PD = 5 + 4.8 = 9.8 cm.

Common Error:
Incorrect calculation of segment lengths.

Q6 (Medium):
Solution:
In cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, ∠A + ∠C = 180° and ∠B + ∠D = 180°. Given ∠B = 70° and ∠C = 110°, we find:
∠D = 180° - 70° = 110°
∠A = 180° - 110° = 70°

Common Error:
Mixing up angles or not ensuring the sum equals 180°.

Q7 (Medium):
Solution:
Since the tangents from an external point to a circle are equal, the line joining the centers of touching circles passes through the point of contact.

Common Error:
Not recognizing the external point condition for tangents.

Q8 (Hard):
Solution:
Since AE and AF are tangents from point A, ∠AEF = ∠AFB (angles in alternate segments). Thus, EF is parallel to BC by corresponding angles.

Common Error:
Misunderstanding the properties of tangents and angles in alternate segments.

Q9 (Hard):
Solution:
Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle OCP where CP is half of AB (4 cm), we find the radius:
OC^2 = OP^2 + CP^2 \Rightarrow r^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 \Rightarrow r = \sqrt{25} = 5 \, \text{cm}
.
For the arc length, with ∠AOB known, use the formula 
\text{Arc length} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r
.

Common Error:
Incorrect calculation of the radius or misunderstanding arc length formula.
