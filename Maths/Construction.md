# ICSE Class 10 Maths - Constructions Chapter Guide

## 1. Key Formulas

### Basic Constructions:
- **Constructing a Line Parallel to a Given Line through a Point**:
  - Draw a line through the point using the angle bisector method or perpendiculars.
  
- **Constructing a Triangle when Sides are Given**:
  - Use SSS (Side-Side-Side) property to construct a triangle.
  
- **Constructing a Triangle when Two Sides and the Included Angle are Given**:
  - Use SAS (Side-Angle-Side) property.
  
- **Constructing a Triangle when Two Angles and the Included Side are Given**:
  - Use ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) property.

- **Bisecting a Given Angle**:
  - Construct two arcs on either side of the angle using a compass and bisect it.
  
- **Perpendicular Bisector of a Given Line Segment**:
  - Using a compass, draw arcs from both ends of the segment and find the intersection of the arcs to draw the bisector.

- **Constructing a Perpendicular from a Point to a Line**:
  - Use the compass to draw arcs above and below the point, then join the intersections to form the perpendicular.

- **Constructing a Circle with a Given Radius**:
  - Using the radius with a compass, place the point at the center and draw the circle.

- **Constructing Tangents to a Circle from an External Point**:
  - Draw the perpendicular from the external point to the center of the circle, then construct the tangents at the point of contact.

## 2. Common Question Patterns

Based on the last 10 years of ICSE Class 10 board exams, the following question patterns have been commonly observed:

1. **Direct Construction Questions**:
   - **Type**: Step-by-step construction, e.g., constructing a triangle or bisecting an angle.
   - **Example**: "Construct a triangle ABC with AB = 5 cm, BC = 6 cm, and ∠B = 60°."

2. **Application-based Questions**:
   - **Type**: Use of constructions in real-life problems, often involving circles or tangents.
   - **Example**: "Construct a tangent to a given circle from an external point."

3. **Reasoning-based Questions**:
   - **Type**: Proofs or explanation of why a construction works.
   - **Example**: "Prove that the perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides it into two equal parts."

4. **Combination Questions**:
   - **Type**: Multiple steps involving several constructions.
   - **Example**: "Construct a triangle and then find the circumcenter or incenter."

### 5. Construct a perpendicular bisector of a given line segment XY = 6 cm.

### 6. Draw a triangle ABC with sides AB = 5 cm, BC = 6 cm, and AC = 7 cm. Also, construct the circumcenter of the triangle.

### 7. Construct a triangle ABC with:
- AB = 7 cm
- AC = 7 cm

### 8. Construct a line parallel to a given line PQ through a point R outside PQ.

## 4. Detailed Solutions

### Solution for Question 1: Construct a Triangle ABC with AB = 6 cm, AC = 8 cm, and ∠A = 60°
- **Step 1**: Draw a line segment AB = 6 cm.
- **Step 2**: At point A, use a protractor to draw ∠A = 60°.
- **Step 3**: Using the compass, measure the length of AC = 8 cm and mark point C on the line of ∠A.
- **Step 4**: Join points B and C to complete the triangle.

### Solution for Question 2: Bisect the Given Angle ∠PQR
- **Step 1**: Place the compass at point Q and draw arcs that intersect both arms of the angle.
- **Step 2**: Using the same radius, draw two arcs from the points of intersection.
- **Step 3**: Join the point where the arcs intersect to point Q. This line is the bisector of the angle.

### Solution for Question 3: Construct Tangents to a Circle from an External Point
- **Step 1**: Draw a circle with a radius of 5 cm.
- **Step 2**: Mark a point outside the circle, say P.
- **Step 3**: Draw the line joining P to the center of the circle and find the midpoint of this line.
- **Step 4**: Using a compass, draw two arcs from the midpoint, each passing through the center.
- **Step 5**: The points of intersection are the points where the tangents meet the circle. Draw the tangents from P.

### Solution for Question 4: Construct a Right-Angled Triangle with BC = 7 cm, AB = 8 cm, and ∠C = 90°
- **Step 1**: Draw the base BC = 7 cm.
- **Step 2**: At point C, use a protractor to construct a right angle (90°).
- **Step 3**: From C, mark the point A at a distance of 8 cm along the perpendicular line.
- **Step 4**: Join A to B to complete the triangle.
