Constructing angles of 60°, 30°, 90°, and 45°.
Advanced Constructions:
Tangents from an external point to a circle.
Circumcircle and incircle of a triangle.
Constructing similar triangles using given scale factors.
Understanding Theorems:

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Easy:
1. Construct a line segment AB of length 7 cm. At point A, construct an angle of 60°.

Solution:
Use a ruler to measure and draw AB = 7 cm.
With A as center and any radius, draw an arc cutting AB at point Q.
With Q as center and the same radius, draw another arc intersecting the first at R.
Join A to R; ∠BAR = 60°.
Common Errors: Incorrect radius leading to an incorrect angle.

2. Construct the perpendicular bisector of a line segment PQ where PQ = 5 cm.

Solution:
Draw PQ.
With P as center and radius more than half of PQ, draw an arc above and below PQ.
Repeat with Q as center, same radius, intersecting the arcs previously drawn.
Connect the intersection points of these arcs; this line is the perpendicular bisector.
Common Errors: Misjudging the radius or not ensuring arcs intersect properly.

Medium:
4. Construct a circle with radius 3 cm and draw its tangents from a point 5 cm away from the center.

Solution:
Draw a circle with center O and radius 3 cm.
Mark point P, 5 cm from O.
Join OP.
Construct the perpendicular bisector of OP, meeting at M. 
With M as center and radius equal to MO, draw a circle intersecting the original circle at A and B.
Join PA and PB; these are the tangents.
Common Errors: Miscalculating the perpendicular bisector or radius for the second circle.

5. Construct triangle ABC with given specifications and then a similar triangle.

Solution:
Draw AB = 6 cm.
From B, construct an angle of 60° and extend to C where BC = 5 cm.
Draw AC. Now, ΔABC is constructed.
For the similar triangle, draw a line from B making an acute angle with BC.
Mark equal segments on this line for the ratio 3:4.
Draw parallel lines to AC and BC through these points to form the similar triangle.
Common Errors: Inaccuracy in drawing parallel lines or incorrect ratio marking.

Hard:
8. Construct triangle ABC and a similar one with reduced sides.

Solution:
Draw AB = 6 cm, ∠B = 60°, and BC = 8 cm.
Similar triangle construction involves drawing a line from B at an angle, marking points for ratio 5:6, then drawing parallel lines to form the new triangle.
Common Errors: Misalignment of angles and incorrect scaling.

9. Construct tangents and prove equality.

Solution:
Draw circle with center O, radius 4 cm, and point P at 10 cm.
Construct tangents as in question 4.
Prove tangents equal by showing tangents from an external point are equal in length.
Common Errors: Proof errors in geometric reasoning.
