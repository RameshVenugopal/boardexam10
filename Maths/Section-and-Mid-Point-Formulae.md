# Section and Mid-Point Formulae - ICSE Class 10 Maths

## 1. Key Formulas

### Section Formula
The section formula is used to find the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment in a given ratio.

- **Section Formula** (internal division):
  If a point \( P(x, y) \) divides the line segment joining \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \) in the ratio \( m : n \), then the coordinates of \( P \) are:
  \[
  P = \left( \frac{m x_2 + n x_1}{m + n}, \frac{m y_2 + n y_1}{m + n} \right)
  \]

- **Section Formula** (external division):
  If the point \( P \) divides the line segment \( AB \) externally in the ratio \( m : n \), then the coordinates of \( P \) are:
  \[
  P = \left( \frac{m x_2 - n x_1}{m - n}, \frac{m y_2 - n y_1}{m - n} \right)
  \]

### Mid-Point Formula
The midpoint formula is used to find the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment joining two points.

- **Mid-Point Formula**:
  If the endpoints of the line segment are \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \), then the midpoint \( M \) is:
  \[
  M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
  \]

## 2. Common Question Patterns

Based on the last 10 years of ICSE Class 10 board exams, the common types of questions in this chapter are:

- **Direct Questions**: 
  - Use of section and midpoint formulae to find the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment in a given ratio.
  - Use of the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of a line segment.

- **Application-based Questions**:
  - Given a set of coordinates and a ratio, find the point dividing the line segment in that ratio.
  - Questions where you are asked to prove or verify whether a point is the midpoint or divides the segment in a certain ratio.

- **Reasoning-based Questions**:
  - Use of the section formula to deduce geometric properties, like collinearity of points.

### Sample Question 2:
Find the midpoint of the line segment joining the points \( (1, 4) \) and \( (5, 8) \).

### Sample Question 3:
A point \( P \) divides the line segment joining \( A(4, -1) \) and \( B(-2, 3) \) externally in the ratio \( 3:2 \). Find the coordinates of \( P \).

### Sample Question 4:
Prove that the points \( (3, 4) \), \( (5, 8) \), and \( (7, 12) \) are collinear using the section formula.

## 4. Detailed Solutions

### Solution for Sample Question 1:
**Given**: \( A(2, 3) \), \( B(6, 7) \), Ratio \( 2:3 \).

Using the section formula:
\[
P = \left( \frac{2 \times 6 + 3 \times 2}{2 + 3}, \frac{2 \times 7 + 3 \times 3}{2 + 3} \right)
\]
\[
P = \left( \frac{12 + 6}{5}, \frac{14 + 9}{5} \right)
\]
\[
P = \left( \frac{18}{5}, \frac{23}{5} \right)
\]
So, the coordinates of point \( P \) are \( \left( \frac{18}{5}, \frac{23}{5} \right) \).

---

### Solution for Sample Question 2:
**Given**: Points \( (1, 4) \), \( (5, 8) \).

Using the midpoint formula:
\[
M = \left( \frac{1 + 5}{2}, \frac{4 + 8}{2} \right)
\]
\[
M = \left( \frac{6}{2}, \frac{12}{2} \right)
\]
\[
M = (3, 6)
\]
So, the midpoint is \( (3, 6) \).

## 5. Summary

The chapter on Section and Mid-Point Formulae focuses on two key concepts: the section formula and the midpoint formula. The section formula is used to find a point dividing a line segment in a given ratio (internally or externally), while the midpoint formula is used to find the point that is equidistant from the endpoints of a line segment. Mastery of these formulas is essential for solving coordinate geometry problems, and their applications are widespread in both direct and reasoning-based questions in ICSE exams.
