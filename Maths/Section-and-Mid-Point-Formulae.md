ICSE Class 10 Mathematics - Section and Mid-Point Formulae Study Guide
Key Concepts
Section Formula: 
Allows finding the coordinates of a point that divides a line segment joining two points in a given ratio.
Internal Division: Coordinates 
(x, y)
 are given by:
x = \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m + n}, \quad y = \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m + n}
where 
m:n
 is the ratio, and 
(x_1, y_1)
 and 
(x_2, y_2)
 are the endpoints.
External Division: Similar formula but with subtraction for one of the coordinates.
Mid-Point Formula:
Calculates the midpoint of a line segment:
\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)
Centroid of a Triangle: 
The centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1 and can be found using the mid-point formula for each median.

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Easy Questions
1. Coordinates of P dividing AB in the ratio 2:1:

Solution: Using Section Formula:
P(x, y) = \left( \frac{(2 \cdot 3) + (1 \cdot 1)}{2+1}, \frac{(2 \cdot 4) + (1 \cdot 2)}{2+1} \right) = ( \frac{7}{3}, \frac{10}{3} )
Common Error: Misplacing the ratio or forgetting to sum the denominators.

2. Midpoint of segment with endpoints (6, -4) and (2, 8):

Solution: 
M(x, y) = \left( \frac{6+2}{2}, \frac{-4+8}{2} \right) = (4, 2)
Common Error: Dividing each coordinate separately.

3. Coordinates of P dividing AB in the ratio 3:2:

Solution: 
P(x, y) = \left( \frac{3 \cdot (-1) + 2 \cdot 3}{3+2}, \frac{3 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot (-2)}{3+2} \right) = ( \frac{-3 + 6}{5}, \frac{12 - 4}{5} ) = ( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{5} )
Common Error: Incorrect application of signs in calculation.

Medium Questions
4. Centroid of triangle ABC:

Solution: 
G(x, y) = \left( \frac{1+4-2}{3}, \frac{2+6+3}{3} \right) = (1, 3.67)
Reasoning: The centroid is the average of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the vertices.

5. Coordinates of P and Q dividing AB:

Solution for P: 
P(x, y) = \left( \frac{2 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 0}{2+3}, \frac{2 \cdot 12 + 3 \cdot 0}{2+3} \right) = (2.4, 4.8)
Solution for Q: 
Q(x, y) = \left( \frac{3 \cdot 6 + 1 \cdot 0}{3+1}, \frac{3 \cdot 12 + 1 \cdot 0}{3+1} \right) = (4.5, 9)
Common Pitfall: Not recognizing that ratios are internal.

6. Prove midpoint theorem:

Proof: Let A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3) be vertices. Midpoints of AB and AC are M and N respectively. Show MN // BC and length calculation.

7. Coordinates of P and length AP:

Solution: 
P(x, y) = \left( \frac{2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 2}{2+3}, \frac{2 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 3}{2+3} \right) = (3.4, 4.6)
Length AP by distance formula.

Hard Questions
8. Coordinates of D and proof of line equation:

Solution for D: Similar to previous but with proof integration.

9. Collinearity of P and Q:

Solution: Calculate P and Q, then use the slope formula or determinant to show collinearity.
