ICSE Class 10 Maths: Heights and Distances Study Guide
Key Concepts
Angles of Elevation and Depression: 
Angle of Elevation: The angle above the horizontal line from the observer to the object.
Angle of Depression: The angle below the horizontal line from the observer to the object.
Trigonometric Ratios: 
Sine (sin), Cosine (cos), and Tangent (tan) are used to relate angles to the sides of right-angled triangles.
Basic Trigonometric Identities: 
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
Applications in Real-Life Scenarios: 
Solving for heights of buildings, lengths of shadows, distances across rivers, etc.

Difficulty: Hard

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Easy
1. Pole Shadow Calculation:
Solution: 
Use 
\tan 30° = \frac{10}{x}
 where 
x
 is the length of the shadow. 
\tan 30° = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
, so 
x = 10 \sqrt{3}
 meters.
Common Error: Misusing trigonometric ratios or forgetting to take the square root for 
\tan 30°
.

2. Building Height Calculation:
Solution: 
Since the angle is 45°, height equals base. So, the building is 20 meters tall.
Common Error: Confusing the angle with another trigonometric function.

3. Ladder Height Calculation:
Solution: 
Use 
\sin 60° = \frac{h}{5}
, where 
h
 is the height reached on the wall. 
\sin 60° = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
, thus 
h = 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}
 meters.
Common Error: Not recognizing 
\sin 60°
.

Medium
4. Distance Between Boats:
Solution: 
Using 
\tan 30°
 for the first boat and 
\tan 45°
 for the second, calculate distances from the lighthouse. Add these distances for total distance between boats.
Common Error: Miscalculation in using angles or not considering the horizontal distance.

5. River Width and Tree Height:
Solution: 
Use trigonometry to set up equations with both angles, solve for distances and heights simultaneously.
Common Error: Incorrectly linking the two angles without considering the movement.

6. Tower Height from Observer:
Solution: 
Add the observer's height to the height calculated from the angle of elevation.
Common Error: Forgetting to account for observer's eye level.

7. Kite String Length:
Solution: 
Use 
\sin 45° = \frac{30}{L}
, where 
L
 is the string length. Since 
\sin 45° = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
, 
L = 30\sqrt{2}
 meters.
Common Error: Misapplying the sine function.

Hard
8. Cliff and Tower Heights:
Solution: 
Use the tangent of angles to find distances, then solve for heights using ratios or direct subtraction.
Common Error: Not accounting for the height difference between the top and bottom of the tower.

9. Distance Between Poles:
Solution: 
Apply cosine law in a right triangle formed by the poles and their horizontal distance.
Common Error: Using incorrect trigonometric functions or misplacing measurements.

10. Height of Tower with Flagstaff:
Solution: 
Use the tangent function for both angles to set up equations; solve for height of tower after subtracting flagstaff height.
Common Error: Misinterpretation of angles or heights in the problem setup.
