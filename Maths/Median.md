ICSE Class 10 Maths: Median Chapter Study Guide
Key Concepts
Median of Ungrouped Data: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted in ascending or descending order. For an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle numbers.
Median of Grouped Data: For grouped data, the median is found by:
Calculating the cumulative frequency.
Finding the median class where the cumulative frequency exceeds or equals half the total frequency.
Using the formula:
\text{Median} = L + \left(\frac{\frac{N}{2} - F}{f}\right) \times h
where:
L
 is the lower limit of the median class,
N
 is the total number of observations,
F
 is the cumulative frequency of the class before the median class,
f
 is the frequency of the median class,
h
 is the class interval.

Categorization of Patterns
Direct Application: Simple use of median formulas.
Proving or Calculating: Questions that require understanding of the steps to calculate median, especially from grouped data.
Combined Data Problems: Involves merging two or more data sets.

Frequency Analysis
Median of Grouped Data appears in 7 out of the last 10 papers.
Median of Ungrouped Data is seen in 5 out of the last 10 papers.

Variations or Twists
Sometimes, questions might involve finding the median after removing certain elements from the dataset or after combining datasets with different frequencies.

Graded Practice Questions
Easy
Find the median of the numbers: 3, 8, 5, 2, 9.
Calculate the median of the set: 12, 15, 14, 19, 20, 22.
From the data set: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, find the median.

Medium
Given the frequency distribution of marks scored by students:
Marks
Frequency
0-20
5
20-40
10
40-60
15
60-80
10
Find the median.
Two groups of students scored as follows:
Group A: 4, 8, 10, 12, 14
Group B: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Find the median if both groups are combined.
Determine the median of the following data:
Age (Years)
Number of People
10-20
8
20-30
12
30-40
10
40-50
5
If the median of 1, 3, x, 7, 9 is 5, find the value of x.

Hard
A dataset has the following frequency distribution:
Height (cm)
Frequency
150-160
7
160-170
12
170-180
9
180-190
4
If one more person of height 165 cm joins the group, calculate the new median.
Prove that if a number is added to or removed from a set, the median can change by at most one position in the ordered list.
In a dataset, the median score is 75. If one student's score changes from 60 to 80, discuss how this might affect the median, assuming no other scores change.

Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions
Easy
1. Arrange in order: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9. Median = 5.

2. Order: 12, 14, 15, 19, 20, 22. Median = (15 + 19) / 2 = 17.

3. Order: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. Median = 9.

Medium
1. 
N = 40, half = 20.
Median class is 40-60 where cumulative frequency first exceeds 20.
Using formula: Median = 40 + ((20 - 15)/15) * 20 = 46.67.

2. 
Combined set: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14. 
Median = (8 + 8) / 2 = 8.

3.
N = 35, half = 17.5.
Median class: 20-30.
Median = 20 + ((17.5 - 8)/12) * 10 = 27.92.

4. 
Since median is 5, x must be 5 to balance the middle values. Hence, x = 5.

Hard
1.
New total = 33. New median class still 160-170 but adjustments needed:
Median = 160 + ((17 - 7)/12) * 10 = 168.33.

2. 
Adding/removing one number can shift each number by one position max, thus changing the median by at most one position.

3. 
If 60 was below the median and 80 is above, the median could remain unchanged if it was not one of these numbers; otherwise, it shifts up if 80 becomes the new median.

Concise Summary and Key Takeaways
Median for Ungrouped Data: Always middle value; for even numbers, average of two middle values.
Median for Grouped Data: Use formula based on cumulative frequencies.
Be Prepared for Variations: Questions might combine data sets or ask about median changes with alterations to the data.
Practice Both Types: Regular practice with both ungrouped and grouped data is crucial.
Understand Adjustments: Know how adding or removing data points affects the median.

This guide should help you prepare effectively for the ICSE Class 10 Maths exam, focusing on the Median chapter. Remember, understanding the steps and concepts behind each solution is as important as getting the right answer.
