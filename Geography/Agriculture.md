2. **Map Marking**  
   - Locate **West Bengal** in the eastern part of India.  
   - Locate **Punjab** in the north-western part.

*(If you don’t have a map, practice by sketching a rough outline. Accuracy in labeling states is crucial in board exams.)*

**Common Errors**:
- Incorrect labeling of states or mixing up states in the north vs. south.  
- Forgetting to add the map index or legend if required by the exam format.

### 4.3 Solution to Question 3 (Medium)

**Question:** Explain how climate and soil conditions influence the cultivation of wheat in India. Highlight two major wheat-producing states.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Ideal Climate**  
   - Wheat requires **cool and moist** climate during the early growth stage and **warm, dry** climate near harvesting (Rabi season).  
   - Temperature range around **10°C to 25°C**.  
2. **Soil Conditions**  
   - Grows best in **well-drained, loamy soil** with moderate organic content.  
   - The **Gangetic Plains** are very suitable.  
3. **Major Producing States**  
   - **Uttar Pradesh** (largest producer), **Punjab**, and **Haryana** also lead in production.

**Common Errors**:
- Mixing up the conditions required for wheat with those for rice.  
- Forgetting to mention specific states or listing the wrong states known for other crops.
